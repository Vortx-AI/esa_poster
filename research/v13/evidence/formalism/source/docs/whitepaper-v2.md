## Abstract

emem is an external identity layer for AI agents: a shared, verifiable
memory whose purpose is to stop referential drift. A model that carries
its own prose description of a thing carries a description that decays,
and two models carrying two descriptions of one thing cannot tell whether
they are discussing the same thing. emem moves identity out of the model.
Every place resolves to one canonical address (`cell64`, §4). Every
observation there becomes one immutable record whose identifier is the
blake3 hash of its own canonical CBOR bytes (`fact_cid`, §5). A caller
hands another party a token; the token dereferences to those exact bytes,
and an ed25519 receipt over a domain-separated preimage lets the receiver
check them without trusting the sender, the network, or this responder
(§6).

That guarantee is precise, and its edges matter more than its centre.
It holds for `emem:fact:` tokens, where the identifier is a digest of the
stored bytes and the receipt binds `(cell, fact_cid)` into the signed
preimage. It does **not** hold uniformly across the token family:
`emem:entity:` converges two agents on a shared *name*, not on
byte-identical *bytes*, because an entity's identifier is computed from a
deliberately narrow identity preimage rather than from its whole body
(§2). §3 gives the grammar and states, per token type, exactly what
dereferencing proves. §14 collects every such limit in one place. Where a
mechanism proves less than its name suggests, this document says so
rather than let the name do the work.

The protocol is one trust surface over two layers. *Earth memory* is an
open-data corpus addressed by `(cell, band, tslot)` whose unit is a
signed fact. *Agent memory* is a content-addressed file store under
`/memories/*` with six file verbs conforming to the Anthropic memory-tool
specification, four memory kinds drawn from the CoALA agent-memory
ontology, and an ed25519 capability binding on paths under
`/memories/by_attester/<pubkey_short>/`. Both return signed receipts, and
one `/verify` page checks either without trusting the issuer.

Every signature this responder issues follows one rule: ed25519 over
blake3 of a domain-separated, tagged, length-prefixed segment stream
(§6). Two constructions sit outside it, and §6.4 names both. Every read
primitive accepts two optional bounds, `as_of_tslot` (observation time)
and `as_of_signed_at` (transaction time); both enter the signed preimage,
so a verifier in year *t+k* replays the exact query a system answered in
year *t*. Every band declares how its values are produced, in one of six
tamper-provenance classes (§7). An append-only log records attestation
batches under the RFC 6962 tree construction (§8). Callers may register
derivations over parent facts under their own key (§9).

The framing this document commits to follows from the guarantee rather
than preceding it. Generating a plausible account of the world is cheap
and getting cheaper; what stays scarce is a shared account that is
measured, signed, and checkable by someone who was not there. emem is
built to be that account: a substrate agents inherit rather than
re-derive, measured at canonical addresses, signed fact by fact,
bi-temporal, and checkable offline.

## 1. Referential drift

An agent that verifies something and then describes it has already begun
losing it. The description is a lossy re-encoding, and every subsequent
hop re-encodes again: a summary, a compaction pass, a handoff to another
model, a paraphrase in a report. Nothing in the pipeline marks the moment
the meaning changed, because at every step the text still reads fluently.
This is referential drift: the words survive, the referent does not.

Three failure modes follow, and all three are routine rather than exotic.

**Within one agent, across time.** A long task outlives its own context
window. The harness compacts, the session ends, the model is swapped
mid-project. A verified measurement becomes "roughly 3,700 m", then "high
elevation", then an assumption nobody can trace. The agent cannot tell
which of its beliefs are still grounded, because a paraphrase and a
measurement have the same shape in a transcript.

**Between two agents.** Agent A reports "the flood line north of the
river". Agent B reads it and reasons about a different line, at a
different time, from a different source, and neither can detect the
mismatch: both prose descriptions are internally coherent. Absent a
shared referent, the only way B can check A is to redo A's work, which
defeats the point of the handoff.

**Between an agent and an auditor, later.** "What did we know when we
committed the loan?" has no answer if the memory is prose. The forecast
that justified the decision has been superseded by a better forecast, and
the record of what was believed at decision time is gone.

The common cause is that identity lives inside the model. Each model
holds its own description of a thing, and descriptions do not compose:
there is no operation that takes two paraphrases and decides whether they
denote one object. The problem is not that models are careless. It is
that a natural-language description is not an identifier, and using one as
an identifier is a category error that only surfaces later, when the cost
of the mistake has compounded.

The fix is not better prose discipline. It is to give the thing an
address that lives outside every model, that derives from bytes rather
than from who is speaking, and that any party can dereference and check
alone. That is what the rest of this document specifies: an address for
places (§4), a content identifier for observations (§5), a citeable
handle for both (§3), and a signature over the bytes that makes the
handle checkable by someone who trusts nobody (§6).

The claim is narrow, and worth stating precisely because the surrounding
literature is full of larger ones. emem does not stop a model from
paraphrasing, and does not make a recorded value true. It gives the model
something better to carry than a paraphrase: an 83- or 84-character line
that re-hydrates to the exact signed bytes, for anyone, for as long as
the bytes exist. What is guaranteed is co-reference and integrity, never
truth. Confidence, uncertainty, and provenance travel alongside the value
(§7) precisely because the signature speaks to none of them.

### 1.1 Drift has two directions

Everything above describes drift in language: the reference decays while
the world stands still, and the token pins it. The world runs the same
failure in the other direction. The reference stands still, the readout
at it moves, and not every move is the world. A crop grows, but also a
satellite is swapped, a scene registers five metres off, an encoder is
upgraded, a cloud passes. Between two visits to one pinned address, the
observed change decomposes as

```text
Δz = Δ_env + Δ_sensor + Δ_geo + Δ_encoder + ε
```

the world changed, the instrument changed, the pixels moved, the model
changed, noise. Only the first term is about the world, and a memory that
cannot tell the terms apart either raises false alarms or hides real
events. The protocol already pins or separates every term but the first:
an embedding fact carries its encoder checkpoint and versioned recipe, so
Δ_encoder is checkable rather than hidden (§10.1); bi-temporality
separates a change in the world from a change in what the memory knew
(§4.3); every change points at a specific immutable fact (§5); and the
receipt makes whatever split is computed checkable by a third party (§6).
An attribution ledger ships (§10.3): per-term evidence under a signed
receipt. Splitting a delta numerically among the terms is still open
work; nothing in this build computes the split.

## 2. External identity

Identity in emem is layered, and the layers differ in strength. Stating
them as one thing would be the same error this document exists to
correct, so they are separated here and kept separate throughout.

### 2.1 The address layer: places

A place is named by its `cell64` (§4). The address is a pure function of
latitude and longitude: it derives from the geometry, not from who asked
or when. Two agents that resolve the same point converge on the same
address by construction, with no coordination and no registry. This is
the strongest layer because there is nothing to agree about.

### 2.2 The content layer: observations

An observation is named by its `fact_cid`, the blake3 digest of its own
canonical CBOR encoding (§5). The bytes that are hashed are the bytes
that are stored, so the identifier is a checkable claim about the
content: recompute the digest, compare, and a substituted body is
detected. This layer is strong for the same reason: identity is derived
from the object, so agreement is arithmetic rather than negotiation.

### 2.3 The object layer: entities

Places and observations are not the only things agents talk about. A
bridge, a field, a landmark, a facility is an *object*, and objects are
where co-reference is hardest: "the collapsed span at the ford" and "the
Old Bridge" may denote one thing, and no amount of hashing resolves that,
because the phrasings share no bytes.

`POST /v1/entity` mints an `emem:entity:<entity_cid>`. The identifier is
computed by `compute_entity_cid`
(`crates/emem-primitives/src/entity.rs:176`) over one of two preimages:

```text
  with a stable external anchor:
      blake3("emem.entity.v1|ext|" || best_external_id)

  without one:
      blake3("emem.entity.v1|loc|" || cell64 || "|" ||
             normalize_text(kind) || "|" || normalize_text(label))
```

`best()` (`entity.rs:68`) prefers `gers:<id>`, then `osm:<type>/<id>`,
then `wikidata:<qid>`. The digest is truncated to its first 16 bytes and
base32-encoded, so an `entity_cid` is 26 characters, not the 52 of a
`fact_cid`.

The external-anchor branch is the one that works. Two agents that mint
from the same GERS or OSM id converge on the same `entity_cid` however
they phrase the label: the repository's own test asserts that
`("bridge", "Golden Gate Bridge")` and `("highway", "golden gate")` with
the same `osm:way/717919508` produce equal identifiers
(`entity.rs:291`). Geometry is deliberately excluded from the preimage so
that a geocoder's floats cannot perturb the identity (`entity.rs:20`).

The fallback branch is weaker and the responder says so in the response
itself. Without an external id, identity is label-based, and convergence
requires two agents to agree on a normalized label *and* a cell. The API
returns a `convergence` field marked `weak` in exactly that case
(`crates/emem-api-rest/src/lib.rs:22325`).

### 2.4 What the entity layer does not do

Three limits, all load-bearing, none of which the layer's name suggests.

**The mint is not signed over its content.** The receipt accompanying a
mint is signed over the segment set in §6.2: `request_id`, `served_at`,
optional axes, `primitive`, `cells`, `fact_cids`. The `entity_cid` rides
the receipt body as `intent`, and `intent` is not a preimage segment
(`crates/emem-attest/src/lib.rs:217` lists every tag; there is no
`INTENT`). So the receipt proves this responder served an `emem.entity`
request touching that cell at that time. It does not bind the identifier,
the label, the kind, or the external ids. The same applies to
`POST /v1/entity/alias`.

**An `emem:entity:` token does not dereference to byte-identical bytes.**
Because the identifier covers a narrow identity preimage rather than the
whole record, two nodes can hold different bodies under one `entity_cid`:
the stored `label` is the caller's display form, not the normalized form
that was hashed, and in the external-anchor branch `cell64` is not in the
preimage at all. There is no entity analogue of the cell-binding check
that protects facts (§3.3). What two agents holding one `emem:entity:`
token share is a canonical *name*. That is genuinely useful, and it is
less than the fact layer provides.

**There is no merge, and links do not conflict.** Nothing reconciles two
`entity_cid`s later discovered to denote one object. An alias key maps to
a growing list of identifiers: if one agent links "the north dam" to
entity X and another links the same phrase to entity Y, both survive, and
`entity_resolve` returns both as candidates with no contradiction signal
and no precedence.

### 2.5 Resolution is registration, not similarity

`POST /v1/entity/resolve` is an exact lookup on a normalized key
(`lib.rs:22369`). Normalization is trim, lowercase, and collapse internal
whitespace runs (`entity.rs:150`). There is no embedding, no edit
distance, no stemming, no substring match, and no ranking: candidates
come back in insertion order. A phrasing resolves only if that exact
normalized phrasing was previously registered as an alias, by a mint or
by `POST /v1/entity/alias`.

This is worth stating bluntly because the mechanism's value is real but
different from what "resolve" implies. Convergence here is
*registration-based*. Agents converge because someone recorded the
equivalence, not because the system inferred it. The `near` parameter
does not add inference either: it appends every entity indexed at one
exact cell, unranked and unfiltered by the query text.

---

## 3. The token grammar

A token is the citeable handle an agent carries instead of a payload. It
is one line of text, safe in a report, a commit message, a note, or an
audit log.

```text
  emem:fact:defi.zb5ff.pOyA.zaf69:mstu4hkloebwpupenqyubj6qacnrejhiwj4pcszsfltooqettr5q
```

The family is typed by its **second segment**, and the types are not
equivalent in what dereferencing proves. There is one type per shape of
memory: a point, a set, an object, a bare place, and, for a world model,
a field and a field over time.

| Token | Shape | Dereferences to |
|---|---|---|
| `emem:fact:<cell64>:<fact_cid>` | 4 segments | the byte-identical signed fact (§3.2) |
| `emem:bundle:<bundle_cid>` | 3 segments | a signed set of citations |
| `emem:entity:<entity_cid>` | 3 segments | the body this node holds under that name (§2.4) |
| `emem:cell:<cell64>` | 3 segments | **nothing: no parser exists** (§3.4) |
| `emem:raster:<aoi_cid>:<band>:<tslot>:<derivation_cid>` | 5 segments | one native-resolution field over an area, as a signed derivation (§3.6) |
| `emem:cube:<aoi_cid>:<band>:<tslot_lo>..<tslot_hi>:<derivation_cid>` | 5 segments | a field over time: a signed manifest over raster slices (§3.6) |
| `emem:rasterset:<bundle_cid>:<derivation_cid>` | 3 segments | a signed manifest binding N field tokens across bands into one citeable set (§3.6) |

Three legacy prefixes still resolve as full equivalents, not as degraded
forms: `memt:` for `emem:fact:`, `memb:` for `emem:bundle:`, `meme:` for
`emem:entity:`. Each is a single fallback on the prefix strip
(`lib.rs:20574`, `memory_bundle.rs:190`, `entity.rs:208`); the remainder
of the parse is identical. A resolve echoes the canonical spelling back,
so a legacy token is migrated by using it.

### 3.1 Why the second segment, and not a length

`parse_memory_token` (`lib.rs:20570`) strips the prefix and splits the
remainder exactly once, on the first colon. `cell64` is colon-free by
construction, so the split is unambiguous however long the digest is, and
the `fact_cid` is whatever follows. A shape check rejects the rest: the
cell must satisfy `is_cell64_shape`, and the digest must be
ASCII-alphanumeric within a length bound.

Length is not the discriminator, and cannot be: a `fact_cid` is 52
characters (the full 32-byte blake3 digest, base32-nopad-lowercase),
while an `entity_cid` and a `bundle_cid` are 26 (their preimages are
truncated to 16 bytes). Three identifier widths in one family is a wart,
and it is documented here rather than smoothed over.

### 3.2 What an `emem:fact:` token proves

This is the token the anti-drift claim rests on, and it is the one that
carries it.

The identifier is the digest of the stored bytes. `put_many`
(`crates/emem-cache/src/sled_hot.rs:446`) encodes the fact to canonical
CBOR, hashes *those* bytes, and inserts *those same bytes* under the
resulting key. Resolution reads them back and returns them inline. The
receipt over a resolve is signed with `fact_cids` populated
(`lib.rs:20766`), so unlike the entity paths, the identifier genuinely
enters the signed preimage.

The chain a receiver can check alone is therefore: the CID names the
bytes; the cell-binding rule refuses a mislabelled anchor (§3.3); the
receipt binds `(cell, fact_cid)` to the responder's key in a
domain-separated, length-prefixed preimage (§6); and every step verifies
offline.

One honest qualification. The responder does not recompute the digest on
read and compare it before serving; integrity of the read path rests on
the store's keying being honest. The *client* can and should recompute
it, which is the entire point of content addressing. The correct sentence
is "a client can detect a substituted body by recomputing the CID", not
"the responder guarantees the body matches the CID".

### 3.3 The cell-binding rule

A token names both a place and a digest, which creates a way to lie that
content addressing alone does not catch: cite a real Mumbai fact under a
Fuji cell. The resolver refuses it (`lib.rs:20728`). It reads the cell out
of the signed fact body, compares it against the cell in the token, and
returns **409 Conflict** on any mismatch rather than resolving with a
warning. The `cell` in a successful response is taken from the signed
body, never from the token.

This is the only cross-field integrity check in the token family. Bundles
and entities have no analogue, and §14 records that.

### 3.4 `emem:cell:` does not dereference

`cell_token` (`lib.rs:20561`) composes the string, and nothing anywhere
parses it. It appears in composed output and in reference documentation;
it has no resolution path. It is listed here for completeness and because
a previous version of this document's supporting material claimed
otherwise. A place is addressed directly by its `cell64`; the `emem:cell:`
wrapper adds nothing that resolves.

### 3.5 `bundle_cid` is not a CBOR digest

`compute_bundle_cid` (`memory_bundle.rs:139`) hashes a pipe- and
newline-delimited **text** preimage of the citations, then truncates to 16
bytes:

```text
  blake3("emem.memory_bundle.v1|" || purpose || "\n" ||
         (cell "|" band "|" tslot "|" fact_cid "\n")*)[..16]
```

It is not `blake3(canonical_cbor(body))`, which the module's own
docstring two lines above the function claims it is. The code is
authoritative and the docstring is wrong; both are noted in §16 because a
verifier that believes the docstring computes the wrong identifier.

### 3.6 Field tokens: what the receipt attests when the answer is an array

The scalar and identity tokens above split on the **first** colon (§3.1),
because everything after `<cell64>:` is one opaque digest. The field tokens
do not: `emem:raster:`, `emem:cube:`, and `emem:rasterset:` carry multiple
colon-separated claims, and their parsers (`band_raster.rs`) split on every
colon and bind each claim to the signed record before anything dereferences.
A world model is a field over an area across time, and a scalar fact cannot
name one; these can. The family covers a raw scene window, a cloud-free
composite, a static terrain field, a field over time, a foundation-encoder
embedding, and a manifest binding any set of them.

A field token names an **array**, so its receipt attests a *derivation*,
not a value: this responder computed the artifact whose blake3 is
`artifact_cid`, from a pinned Sentinel-2 scene, via the versioned recipe
`band_raster@1`, over a content-addressed area (`aoi_cid`, the blake3 of
the request geometry) and time slot. The receipt's FIELD preimage segment
binds `(aoi_cid, derivation_cid)` through `emem_attest::field_binding_v1`,
reported by `/v1/verify_receipt` as `field_bound`. The pixels are a
canonical little-endian `f32` grid with a fixed 64-byte header
(`emem-codec/grid.rs`); a NaN folds to one quiet NaN and `-0.0` to `0.0`
before hashing, or two encoders that agree on every value still disagree
on the digest.

The artifact is evictable by design. It lives in a content-addressed blob
store served immutable at `GET /v1/artifacts/{cid}`; the small derivation
record persists like any fact and pins the scene, recipe, and geometry, so
eviction turns a dereference into a recompute, never a broken citation.

The same `emem:raster:` grammar names more than one raw scene window. A
cloud-free masked-median composite over a date range (`s2_median_composite@1`),
a static terrain-elevation field read straight from a Copernicus GLO-30 tile
with no scene selection (`dem_raster@1`), and a foundation-encoder embedding
field (`embedding_raster@1`) are all raster-shaped derivations that resolve
through the same fail-closed binding. The embedding field is the one that
needed the grid encoding to grow: a `channels` count lives in the header
(offset 56), so a pixel can carry the encoder's whole N-dimensional vector
(128-D for GeoTessera), stored pixel-interleaved. A single-channel grid writes
zero there and encodes **byte-identically** to the pre-channels format, so no
existing `artifact_cid` moved when the dimension was added. Each filled
embedding cell is a real per-cell recall, so its `fact_cid` anchors that
column: the field terminates in signed facts, never invented pixels.

Composition has two levels. A cube adds no pixels: `emem:cube:` is a signed
manifest over N independently-resolvable raster slices, one per date, and
`cube_cid` is the blake3 of the ordered member `derivation_cid`s, so the same
slices in the same order always name the same cube and a resolve recomputes it
and refuses an altered membership with a typed 409. `emem:rasterset:`
generalises that across bands rather than time: it binds any set of
already-minted field tokens (a world's ground composites, its DEM geometry,
its embedding layer) into one manifest a report or a world cites, with the
same content-addressed-membership guarantee. Neither mints pixels; each
member's lineage terminates in its own pinned source, so a stranger walks the
manifest to the members to the scenes and re-derives every value from raw
satellite bytes.

Verification has the two tiers §3.2's fact token has, at field size, and the
spot-check tier is a live endpoint. Spot-check (milliseconds, no upstream):
`POST /v1/raster/resolve {token, spot_check: true}` decodes the artifact grid,
reads each anchor's value back out at its pixel, and, where an anchor carries
a `fact_cid`, cross-checks it against the ordinary per-cell fact. A field
pixel that resolves to a signed receipt whose value matches is the
click-to-verify a regulator wants; an edge anchor with no pixel is reported
inconclusive, not failed. Recompute (the full audit): fetch the pinned scene,
rerun the recipe, compare digests. A field token carries no new trust class:
the artifact inherits the band's provenance and the record says so.

## 4. Addressing: cell64 and tslot

### 4.1 cell64

A `cell64` is a 64-bit packed identifier for a square latitude/longitude
bucket on WGS-84 (`crates/emem-codec/src/geo.rs`).

```text
  bit:  63    60 59      52 51      44 43            22 21            0
        +-------+-----------+-----------+----------------+----------------+
        | mode  | resolution|   base    |     lat_q      |     lng_q      |
        | 0001  |    21     |   0xab    |    21 bits     |    22 bits     |
        +-------+-----------+-----------+----------------+----------------+
```

`mode = 1` marks a geo cell, `base = 0xab` is the geo aperture marker,
and `resolution = 21` distinguishes the active grid from the pre-0.0.3
305 m grid. A legacy cell64 fails decoding with `NotGeoCell` rather than
silently misplacing a fact by hundreds of metres.

The string form is four base-65,536 bigrams joined by `.`, drawn from a
65,536-entry alphabet (`crates/emem-codec/src/alphabet.rs:48`); four
16-bit digits are exactly the 64 bits of the address. Bigram widths vary,
so the rendered cell is 20 to 22 characters and an `emem:fact:` token is
correspondingly 83 to 85. The alphabet is constructed so adjacent
codepoints map to adjacent cells.

**It is not token-economical, and earlier drafts of this paper said it
was.** Measured over 14 live cells: a cell64 costs a mean 12.5 BPE tokens
under cl100k_base and 12.1 under o200k_base, range 11 to 15. Four bigrams
do not become four tokens; the alphabet was built for adjacency and a
BPE vocabulary was never trained on it, so each bigram fragments. At a
comparable pitch H3 r12 costs 8.5, a 10-character geohash 7.5 to 8.0, and
a hex-rendered S2 id 7.5 to 8.0. cell64 is therefore the MOST expensive
of the four in the unit that bills a context window, by about 50% against
H3. The design intent stands and is not yet achieved; §14.5 records it as
an open limit rather than a property.

The pitch is ~9.54 m on the latitude axis and ~9.55 m on the longitude
axis at the equator, chosen to match the native pitch of Sentinel-1 and
Sentinel-2. Latitude pitch is uniform; longitude pitch narrows with
cos(lat), so a cell at 60° is about 9.54 m by 4.77 m. Cells are square at
the equator and taller than wide elsewhere. The responder declares this
itself, with its own warnings, at `GET /v1/grid_info`; an equal-area hex
DGGS is the spec target and is not what this build serves.

### 4.2 tslot

A `tslot` is a `u64` bucket of the Unix timeline at a band's tempo
cadence (`crates/emem-core/src/tslot.rs`).

```text
  tslot = floor(unix_seconds / tempo.slot_seconds())
```

The anchor is the Unix epoch. Pre-1970 timestamps clamp to `tslot(0)`.
The cadence is a property of the band, not of the query: a weather band
and a forest-loss band bucket the same instant differently, because
asking for "the same time" means different things to a fast and a slow
observable.

### 4.3 Bi-temporality

Every read primitive accepts two independent optional bounds:
`as_of_tslot` bounds *observation* time (what was on the ground) and
`as_of_signed_at` bounds *transaction* time (what the memory knew). Set
either, both, or neither.

The distinction is what makes "what did we know when we decided"
answerable. A forecast superseded next week is still the forecast that
was acted on, and `as_of_signed_at` replays it without hindsight. Both
bounds enter the signed preimage as a tagged segment when present (§6.2),
so the replay is checkable rather than asserted.

---

## 5. Content addressing

A fact's identifier is the blake3 digest of its own canonical CBOR
encoding, base32-encoded without padding and lowercased: 32 bytes, 52
characters. The property that matters is not the hash function but the
discipline around it, stated in the encoder's own header
(`crates/emem-fact/src/cbor.rs:4`): *two implementations must produce
byte-identical CBOR for the same fact*. Without that, a content address
is a per-implementation opinion.

Two rules deliver it, and both are narrower than "canonical CBOR"
implies.

**Struct field order is declaration order, not sorted.** `to_canonical_cbor`
serializes through ciborium and serde, which emit fields in declaration
order. It does *not* apply RFC 8949 §4.2.1 key sorting to struct maps. A
generic canonical-CBOR encoder that sorts keys computes a different
digest and will not interoperate. For freeform maps, callers must supply
pre-sorted keys; the encoder will not sort on their behalf.

**Floats are canonicalized before hashing.** Every NaN payload folds to
one quiet NaN and `-0.0` becomes `0.0` (`cbor.rs:43`). Without this, two
encoders that agree on the value disagree on the bytes, and the address
splits.

These are the kind of details a specification usually omits and an
implementer then discovers through a mismatched digest. They are stated
here because a content address is a promise about bytes, and a promise
about bytes has to descend to bytes.

---

## 6. Trust: receipts and attestations

Every answer carries an ed25519 receipt that verifies offline against the
responder's published key. No callback, no account, no API key. The
receiver checks arithmetic, not reputation.

### 6.1 One rule

Every object this responder signs uses a single construction: ed25519
over blake3 of a domain-separated, tagged, length-prefixed segment
stream.

```text
  stream    = "emem.preimage.v1\x00" || u32LE(len(domain)) || domain
              || segment*
  segment   = tag:u8 || u32LE(len) || bytes
  list      = tag:u8 || u32LE(count) || (u32LE(len) || bytes)*
  signature = ed25519(blake3(stream))
```

Optional segments are omitted entirely rather than written empty, so
presence and absence are unambiguous in the signed bytes. The signature
covers the 32-byte digest, not the raw stream.

Six object classes ride this rule today: the receipt, the attestation,
the transparency-log STH, a witness co-signature, the operator
attestation, corpus state stats, and stream ticks. Each declares its
domain string and its tag table at `GET /v1/verifier_spec`.

### 6.2 The receipt preimage

```text
  domain "receipt"
    0x01 request_id      0x06 manifest      (optional)
    0x02 served_at       0x07 primitive
    0x03 scope    (opt)  0x08 cells         (list)
    0x04 as_of    (opt)  0x09 fact_cids     (list)
    0x05 edges    (opt)
```

Two consequences are worth naming. The `as_of` bound **is** signed, so a
bi-temporal replay is checkable rather than asserted. And `intent` is
**not** in the table: it rides the receipt body but never enters the
signed bytes, which is why the entity mint and alias paths prove less
than their names suggest (§2.4).

### 6.3 Why v1 exists, and why v0 still verifies

The v0 rule concatenated variable-length fields with no length prefixes
and inserted optional fields untagged at a fixed position. Both are
exploitable ambiguities rather than aesthetic faults:

- Without length prefixes, `"abc" || "def"` and `"abcd" || "ef"` hash
  identically. Field boundaries were unsigned.
- An untagged optional 64-char hex segment is indistinguishable from any
  other. A scope digest and an `as_of` digest occupied the same position
  and the signature could not tell them apart.

The v0 Merkle construction had a third: leaves and interior nodes were
hashed with the same function, and odd layers duplicated their last
element, so `root([A,B,C]) == root([A,B,C,C])`. This is the CVE-2012-2459
pattern. v1 prefixes leaves with `0x00` and interior nodes with `0x01`,
and verifiers of v1 attestations must additionally reject duplicate
leaves; canonical order is sorted, so duplicates are adjacent.

Every new receipt is signed under v1 and carries `preimage_version: 1`.
Receipts signed before the cutover carry no such field and continue to
verify byte-for-byte under the v0 branch, which is retained for
verification and never for emission. Deleting v0 would silently
invalidate history, which is the one thing an immutable record may not
do.

### 6.4 The two exceptions, named rather than hidden

**Legacy v0 receipts.** Verify-only, never emitted, as above.

**`memory_write`.** The one construction that is not preimage_v1, because
it runs in the opposite direction: the *caller* signs and this responder
verifies.

```text
  attester_preimage = blake3("emem.memory_write|" || verb || "|"
                             || path || "|" || body_hash)
```

`verb` is one of `create | str_replace | insert | delete | rename`. The
pipe form is deliberately frozen rather than migrated: its shape is
pinned by every client that already signs against it, and re-cutting it
would invalidate signatures already issued. It is safe despite the
separator because the variable field is bracketed: `verb` comes from a
closed, separator-free set, and `body_hash` is a fixed-length 32-byte
digest tail.

`body_hash` is **per-verb**, and this is where a reader of v1 goes wrong:

| verb | `body_hash` |
|---|---|
| `create` | blake3 of the `file_text` UTF-8 bytes, exactly as transmitted |
| `str_replace` | blake3 of the whole file's bytes **after** the edit |
| `insert` | blake3 of the whole file's bytes **after** the insert |
| `delete` | `blake3("")` |
| `rename` | `path` is the **new** path; `body_hash` is blake3 of the **old** path |

The responder never hashes the request body. v1 of this document said it
did (§16), and a client that implemented v1's rule could not produce a
signature this responder accepts.

`rename` earns its own line. Hashing the source path is what makes one
signature bind both ends of the move. Without it, the signature
authorises "move something to `new_path`" while naming no source, and a
captured signature could be replayed to drag a different file to the same
destination.

### 6.5 Capability, not account

A write to `/memories/by_attester/<pubkey8>/...` is accepted only from
the key whose shortcode matches, where `pubkey8` is the first 8
characters of the base32-nopad lowercased pubkey. A mismatch returns
**403 `memory_namespace_violation`**. There is no registration step: any
ed25519 keypair works, generated locally, and the namespace is claimed by
whoever first writes to it and then held by that key. Bare `/memories/...`
paths accept writes with no attester block, for Anthropic memory-tool
back-compatibility.

Verification is `ed25519_dalek::verify_strict`, which rejects malleable
signatures.

A refusal is designed to be actionable in one turn: the 401 carries the
exact 32-byte digest to sign for that exact request, the base32 encoding
rules, the per-verb body-hash rule, and a runnable example. An agent gets
from refusal to signed write without going to look for documentation.

### 6.6 The spec cannot drift from the signer

`GET /v1/verifier_spec` is emitted by the responder from the same
compiled constants the signer uses: the tag tables are serialized from
`receipt_tag::*` and the domain strings from the modules that sign, so
the published spec cannot disagree with the wire. A number re-typed into
prose can rot; a symbol serialized from the signer cannot.

This document is prose, and prose rots. That is not a hypothetical: it is
what happened to v1 (§16), and it is why the machine-readable spec, not
this text, is normative where the two ever disagree.

---

## 7. Tamper-provenance

A signature proves who attested a value and that the bytes have not
changed. It says nothing about how the value came to exist. A satellite
radiance, an index recomputed from that radiance, a neural encoder's
embedding, and a human cartographer's judgement are all equally signable
and are not equally checkable. Collapsing them into one trust surface
would be the interesting lie: everything looks verified, so nothing is.

Every band therefore declares a **tamper-provenance class**
(`crates/emem-core/src/bands.rs:64`). There are seven.

| class | `tamper_evidence` | deterministic | rank |
|---|---|---|---|
| `direct_sensor` | `recomputable_from_source` | yes | 5 |
| `deterministic_index` | `recomputable_from_source` | yes | 4 |
| `estimator` | `rerunnable_from_signed_inputs` | no | 3 |
| `attested_execution` | `verified_execution_trace` | no | 3 |
| `model_output` | `signed_model_checkpoint` | no | 2 |
| `human_curated` | `attester_only` | no | 1 |
| `unclassified` | `attester_only` | no | 0 |

`attested_execution` is the device-substrate class. A robot, telescope,
microscope, or operator satellite cannot offer recomputability the way
the open Earth archive can: a sensor reading is a one-time physical event.
Its value is admitted instead through a verified OS execution trace whose
merkle root and device signature bind the emitted output, from a device
key attested to a whitelisted platform. Tamper-evident, but through
verified execution rather than re-derivation, so it ranks below the two
recomputable classes and above a model checkpoint.

`unclassified` is not a placeholder. It is the serde default, so a band
that fails to declare a class fails *closed*, at the lowest rank,
claiming no tamper-evidence. An unknown band key resolves to it rather
than to an optimistic guess.

The 43 bands of the active ontology distribute as 23 `model_output`, 7
`deterministic_index`, 6 `direct_sensor`, 5 `human_curated`, and 2
reserved slots left `unclassified`. Sentinel-1/2 raw, the DEMs,
nightlights, and GMRT are `direct_sensor`; spectral indices, terrain
derivatives, and phenology are `deterministic_index`, of which only
spectral indices are wired to a materializer and the remaining six are
declared slots with no connector; the foundation encoders, land cover,
surface water, and climate are `model_output`; Overture, protected areas,
ecoregions, and admin boundaries are `human_curated`.

### 7.1 The reader's controls

`deterministic: true` on a read is sugar that folds to a class list: it
keeps `direct_sensor` and `deterministic_index` and drops the rest. An
explicit `provenance` list intersects with it; an empty intersection is a
typed 400 rather than a silent empty result. The filter runs before facts
load and before the receipt is signed, so the signed preimage covers
exactly what was returned.

Three classes carry an in-band `caution` string, emitted from a single
definition site: `model_output` warns that a learned representation is a
hypothesis subject to training bias, domain shift, and encoder revision;
`human_curated` warns about editorial choices and coverage gaps that vary
by region; `unclassified` warns that the production method is undeclared.
`direct_sensor` and `deterministic_index` carry none.

### 7.2 What the class attests, and what it does not

`bands_cid` is the blake3 of the canonical CBOR of the band registry. It
enters `source_versions`, which is hashed into `manifest_hex` and mixed
into the receipt preimage as tag `0x06` (§6.2). So a verifier can
reproduce *which classification table was in force* when an answer was
signed, offline.

Six limits, each of which the mechanism's name invites a reader to miss.

**The class is an editorial declaration, not a measurement.** It is a
hand-maintained field in a JSON table, per band. Nothing in the codebase
re-derives a value to check its label. `deterministic: true` means "this
band is *declared* recomputable", never "this value *was* recomputed".

**`bands_cid` attests the table, not the fact.** It proves which table
was in force. It does not prove the classification is correct, nor that
the responder applied it faithfully to the value it returned.

**The manifest segment is optional.** A receipt with no manifest binding
still verifies; `verify_receipt` reports `manifest_bound: false` rather
than failing. Receipts predating the binding are unbound by design, so
their provenance is not covered.

**The class is per-band, so a fact's own lineage is invisible to it.** An
`indices.ndvi` computed over a cloud-contaminated pixel is
`deterministic_index` all the same. The class says the *formula* is
fixed. It says nothing about whether the *input* was sound.

**The cited source is not content-pinned.** `Source.hash` and
`Source.cid` are `None` on every fact the responder materializes
(`crates/emem-fact/src/fact.rs:207-212`; the only writer of `hash` in the
tree is a CLI demo). A fact pins its source by URL, scheme, id and
capture time, not by a digest of the bytes read. If an upstream object is
reprocessed in place, the receipt still verifies and the recomputation no
longer agrees. `recomputable_from_source` is a claim about the formula,
not about the immutability of the source.

**"Recomputable" is not "bit-identical from the published formula."** The
published form of NDVI is `(B08 - B04) / (B08 + B04)`. The responder
scales each band to reflectance (`DN * 1e-4`) before taking the ratio.
The two are algebraically equal and differ in the last bits: on a
measured Cambridge cell, `0.03959249826348693` against
`0.03959249826348692`, a difference of 2 ULP. Bit-exact agreement
requires the scaling convention, not just the formula. The convention now
travels in the band manifest's `formula` field, so a third party can
reproduce the bits from published information alone.

One further caveat is operational rather than architectural: the caution
rides `band_metadata`, which single-cell `/v1/recall` emits per fact but
which fan-out endpoints such as `recall_polygon` hoist to the response
root at their default verbosity. A caller walking `facts[]` alone on a
fan-out endpoint will not see it.

## 8. The transparency log

Immutability inside one responder is a promise about a data structure.
Immutability a client can *check* is a promise about a log. emem keeps an
append-only Merkle tree over attestation batches and serves proofs
against it.

### 8.1 What it is, precisely

It uses the **RFC 6962 tree construction**, with one substitution that
must be stated up front: the hash is **BLAKE3-256, not SHA-256**. RFC
6962 §2.1 mandates SHA-256. This log is therefore not RFC 6962
conformant, and no Certificate Transparency client, auditor, or monitor
will interoperate with it. What is borrowed is the construction: leaves
are prefixed `0x00`, interior nodes `0x01`, and a lone node is *promoted*
rather than paired with itself, so `root([A,B,C]) != root([A,B,C,C])`. A
test pins exactly that.

This makes the transparency tree structurally distinct from the **batch
root** carried inside a receipt, which uses the older self-pairing
construction and is malleable in the way §6.3 describes. The two trees
are not the same tree, and §8.4 explains why that matters more than it
sounds.

A leaf is `blake3(0x00 || blake3(attestation_cbor))`: the hash of a whole
attestation *batch*, appended from exactly one call site, after
verification. Individual facts are not leaves.

Five endpoints: `GET /v1/log/sth`, `GET /v1/log/inclusion`,
`GET /v1/log/consistency`, `POST /v1/log/witness`, and
`GET /v1/log/witnesses`. Inclusion and consistency proofs are both real,
both pure functions, and both round-trip tested for every leaf at every
size from 1 to 33; the inclusion verifier rejects an over-long path, and
the consistency verifier rejects a forked history.

The STH is signed by the responder's own key over a tagged preimage of
`(tree_size, root, signed_at, responder_pubkey)`. The `log_id` **is** the
responder's pubkey: the log has no identity independent of the server
serving it. It is recomputed and re-signed on every request, so there is
no issuance cadence and no maximum-merge-delay to reason about.

### 8.2 What it proves

Exactly one thing: **to a client that pinned an earlier `(tree_size,
root)` and comes back, the log can prove the current tree is an
append-only extension of what that client already saw.** That is
tamper-evidence against rewriting, for one client, over time.

Absent a pin, the endpoints prove nothing. A first-contact client has no
baseline, and a signed tree head it has never seen before is just an
assertion by the party it is trying to check.

### 8.3 What it does not prove

**It does not prevent split-view equivocation, and cannot today.** The
claim that a responder cannot tell two clients two different histories
does not hold, for four independently sufficient reasons. Every artefact
is served by the accused party: the STH, the proofs, and the witness list
all arrive over the same connection from the same server, and an
equivocating responder serves each victim a self-consistent view of all
three. There is no gossip protocol; detecting a split view is
definitionally impossible without an out-of-band channel between the two
victims, and none exists. Witness independence is unenforceable (§8.5).
And the client must pin and return, which is client-side discipline, not
a protocol guarantee.

**It does not prove the log is complete.** A responder that never appends
logs nothing. The log cannot prove absence, non-omission, or that
anything in particular was ever offered to it.

**It does not prove content is true.** It proves a byte sequence was
appended in an order.

### 8.4 The receipt does not chain to the log

This is the gap most worth stating plainly, because the two mechanisms
read as one system and are not.

A client **cannot currently prove that a fact it was served is in the
transparency log.** The receipt preimage has no log binding: there is no
`sth`, `root`, `tree_size`, or `leaf_index` segment in the tag table
(§6.2). The Merkle proof a receipt does carry is over the batch root, a
different tree. And to query `/v1/log/inclusion?entry_hash=`, a client
would need `blake3(attestation_cbor)` for a batch it never receives and
cannot request, because no endpoint reads an attestation back. There is
no `fact_cid -> leaf_index` index.

In practice the log is auditable as a standalone append-only structure,
disconnected from the facts anyone is actually served. Closing that gap
is tracked as the next increment on this substrate, and until it lands,
the honest description is the one in this paragraph rather than the one
the word "transparency" suggests.

### 8.5 Witnesses are scaffolding, not a network

The mechanism is real: a witness signs `(tree_size, root,
witness_pubkey)` over a tagged preimage, deliberately excluding
`signed_at` so the claim is purely "at size N I saw root R". The
responder verifies with `verify_strict` and refuses to record a root it
cannot reproduce, returning **409 `witness_root_mismatch`**. Submission
is idempotent per `(size, witness)`.

The deployment is not a network. As of this document's date the
production responder carries exactly **one** witness, whose co-signature
is for tree size 476,131 and dated 2026-07-10, tens of thousands of
entries behind the live tree; `GET /v1/log/witnesses` reports the current
state, and that endpoint rather than this sentence is the number to
quote. There is **no witness allowlist, registry, or trust anchor
anywhere in the codebase**, and no witness client or daemon:
`POST /v1/log/witness` accepts any well-formed ed25519 key, so an
operator could mint any number of nominally independent witnesses with a
keygen loop. Nothing tells a client that the one witness key is
independent of the responder key.

A witness co-signature therefore proves only that some key signed a
`(size, root)` pair. It does not prove that key is independent, honest,
ran any check, or is not the operator. The 409 guard protects the
responder from vouching for foreign roots; it does nothing for the
client.

Treat witness co-signing as a demonstrated mechanism awaiting an
operating network. It is listed here as scaffolding because a reader who
took the endpoint's existence for an independence guarantee would be
worse off than one who knew nothing about it.

---

## 9. Caller-registered derivations

The primitives to §8 describe reading a shared memory. `POST /v1/derive`
is the other direction: a caller registers a value *they* computed over
parent facts, under their own key.

```text
  sig       = ed25519(blake3("emem.memory_write|derive|/v1/derive|"
                             || body_hash))
  body_hash = blake3(cbor(DeriveBody))
```

The binding reuses the §6.4 attester scheme verbatim, with `verb =
"derive"`. One scheme, one verifier. The verb is what separates the
domains: no memory-file verb is spelled `derive`, so a signature minted
for a file write can never be replayed as a derivation, or the reverse,
and tests pin both directions. `/v1/derive` sits outside the
`by_attester` prefix, so the namespace rule is a no-op and the signature
binds content alone.

Four rules make a registered derivation worth citing.

**Parents must resolve.** Every input token is parsed, fetched, and
cell-bound (§3.3) before anything is written. Unvalidated lineage is
worse than no lineage: it would let a caller mint a token whose ancestry
appears to terminate in signed measurements when it terminates in
nothing.

**The value is canonicalized before hashing**, so the digest the caller
signs and the bytes that get stored describe the same number. Doing it
afterwards would sign one value and store another.

**Callers may declare only `model_output` or `human_curated`.**
`direct_sensor` and `deterministic_index` assert tamper-evidence this
responder cannot check for a value it did not compute; accepting them
would be the responder vouching for a stranger's arithmetic.

**The responder signs the storage, not the truth.** The receipt attests
that this attester submitted this derivation over these parents at this
time and that this responder stored it. It does not attest that the value
is correct. The caller's binding is recorded inside the fact body, hence
inside the `fact_cid`, hence covered by the responder's signature, so a
third party holding only the fact can rebuild the signed body and
re-check the *caller's* signature without the original request.

Derivatives carry no canonical `(cell, band, tslot)` key, so they never
enter the canonical, multi-attester, or scope indexes, and no default
read returns them. This is structural rather than a filter: every keyed
read walks one of those indexes. Retrieval requires naming the thing,
either by its token or through `POST /v1/derived`, which requires an
attester pubkey. A stranger's derivation cannot pollute the shared memory
at a cell, and the author's own token still resolves for anyone holding
it.

### 9.1 Recomputation: earning `deterministic_index`

The four rules above hold a derivation at `model_output`: attributed, not
checked. There is one narrow, safe path to more. When the caller pins a
`code_cid` and the `op` is a pure scalar function the responder can
reproduce with no code execution (`delta` = `inputs[1] - inputs[0]`,
`mean`, `sum`), the responder re-runs that op over the cited parent facts
and compares the two scalars as canonical f64. If they agree, the
derivation is recorded as `deterministic_index`: recomputed, not merely
attributed. On a mismatch, or an op the responder cannot reproduce, it
stays `model_output` with an explicit reason. A derivation with no
`code_cid` is untouched.

What "agree" means is not the same for every op, and the difference is
worth stating plainly rather than rounding off. An op that does not
accumulate compares exactly: `delta` is one subtraction, a classification
is a tree of 2-ary selections, and a two-parent reduction has nothing to
accumulate, so the recomputed and claimed values are equal bit for bit or
the check fails. Rule `canonical_float_equality`, tolerance 0. A
reduction over many parents is a different object. Measured on this
responder over real signed NDVI parents, `sum`:

```text
  parents N   ULP gap   strict equality would
  ---------   -------   ---------------------
          5         0   verify
         16         1   fail
         32         2   fail
         64         2   fail
        128         0   verify
```

Two things follow. The gaps are one or two representable steps, about
1e-16 relative, against 1e-6 as the tightest threshold any decision in
this study evaluates, so no gap inside the window can change an outcome.
And the failure is not monotonic in N, because accumulation error cancels
as readily as it compounds: under strict equality, whether a given sum
verifies is unpredictable from the caller's side, which is worse than a
stated bound because it looks like a guarantee. So `mean` and `sum` over
more than two parents compare under a published 4-ULP window, rule
`reduction_ulp_window`.

The window is never silent, and that is what keeps it a verifier rather
than slack. Every response carries `rule` (which comparison ran),
`ulp_tolerance` (the bound), and `ulp_gap` (the measured distance), on
success and on failure alike. A caller who needs bit-identity demands gap
0 and can see it. A verifier that says "equal within 4 ULP, measured gap
2" is still a verifier; one that says "equal" while meaning "close" is
not.

What this means when two agents compare aggregates, raised by a consumer
building a multi-agent handoff: if A and B each compute the same
reduction independently, they may differ in the last bits and **neither
is wrong**. f64 addition is not associative, so a different accumulation
order is a different exact answer, and no order was ever specified for
them to share. Consensus between agents must therefore be taken over the
published window and its measured `ulp_gap`, never over bit equality. An
agent that treats a 1-ULP disagreement as a contradiction will
manufacture conflicts out of arithmetic; one that treats "equal" as
"close" without reading `ulp_gap` will miss real ones. The gap is
reported on every comparison precisely so neither has to guess. Leaf
facts are the exception and the reason the boundary exists: those are
compared byte for byte, so two agents holding the same `fact_cid` either
hold identical bytes or do not.

The boundary is what was signed. A leaf fact's `value_verbatim` is the
signed preimage, so its bytes are cryptographically load-bearing and are
compared byte for byte, with no tolerance, ever. Nobody signed the sum.
The responder derives it, and no accumulation order was ever specified
for a caller to match, so bit-equality there would be luck about
summation order rather than fidelity to a signature. That is the real
limit on what deterministic recomputation can promise across a language
boundary: exact reproduction is available for ops with no accumulation,
and reductions verify to a published bound with the measured gap
returned.

This does not weaken the "callers may declare only `model_output` or
`human_curated`" rule. The caller still declares `model_output`; the
recomputation is a **separate responder-signed record** in the fact's
`args`, alongside the caller's untouched declared class, so the caller's
offline authorship check (§6.4) still verifies bit-for-bit. The
determinism is the responder's own vouch, recorded next to the claim,
never overwriting it. Non-scalar parents (vectors, enums, absences) and
non-pure ops never reach the recomputation, so a determinism stamp can
never be granted over arithmetic the responder did not perform: a claim
that hides, say, BLAS nondeterminism cannot pass. This is tier 1. A
sandboxed re-execution of arbitrary `code_cid` (tier 2) is designed and
not built; a world is deterministic by parts once each pure
sub-derivation earns tier 1, which is why the sandbox is only for the
genuinely irreducible steps. The recomputation receipt is returned on
`/v1/derive` and travels in the stored fact.

---

## 10. Substrate: Earth observation

Nothing in §2 through §9 is satellite-specific. The record, the receipt,
and the token grammar know about addresses, bytes, and keys. Earth
observation is the substrate this responder ships with, chosen because it
is the hardest honest test available: open, adversarially large, and
already full of the drift the protocol exists to stop.

Open data from ESA, NASA, USGS, and the EU JRC fills the memory on
demand: **46 declared source schemes** and **118 materializer-wired
measurements**, live at `/v1/sources` and `/v1/bands`, spanning elevation
and NDVI through weather, forest change, surface water, and the Tessera
foundation embedding. **168 algorithms** and **27 topics** are
enumerated at `/v1/algorithms` and `/v1/topics`.

### 10.1 Bands: the 1792-dimension voxel

The band ontology declares **43 cube slots** summing to exactly **1792
dimensions**. Offsets are contiguous, and reserved slots leave room for
new bands without breaking existing offsets.

```text
  offset  dims  key                family       tempo   privacy
  ------  ----  -----------------  -----------  ------  --------
       0   128  geotessera         vision       slow    public
     128    64  overture           human        slow    public
     192     7  air_quality        climate      ultra   public
     199   505  _reserved_512      reserved     static  public
     704    10  sentinel2_raw      optical      fast    public
```

The gap between 43 slots and 118 wired names is parametric expansion:
every Sentinel-2 reflectance band, every spectral index, every Tessera
vintage, and every Open-Meteo variant rides a fixed underlying slot.

The ontology is compiled into the binary (`include_str!` over
`bands-v0.json`) and read through one `LazyLock` by every consumer. There
is no env var, no file load, and no runtime override: a deployment that
wants a different ontology recompiles. The module's own header claims a
hot-swap capability that does not exist in the code, and §16 records
that.

### 10.2 Beyond satellites: devices, and subjects that are not places

Any observer with a signing key and an address can join the same attest,
recall, cite, verify path. `POST /v1/attest` is the multi-writer endpoint
that ships today. What also ships now is the machinery that admits a
*device* (a robot, telescope, microscope, drone, or operator satellite)
whose one-time physical reading no third party can recompute:

- The **substrate-profile registry** (`GET /v1/substrates`, the ninth
  content-addressed manifest) states, per contributor class, the admission
  rule and the trace layers it requires. The founding Earth substrate is
  admitted by recomputability from open archives; every device-borne
  profile is admitted by **execution evidence**.
- The **device-platform whitelist** (`GET /v1/device_platforms`) names
  which hardware platforms the protocol will believe and how each proves
  it is genuine: a root of trust (TCG DICE, IEEE 802.1AR DevID, TPM 2.0
  quote, Arm PSA / EAT) whose anchor endorses the device key, following
  the IETF RATS architecture (RFC 9334). Platforms are grouped into
  families (edge AI, trusted hosts, secure MCUs, silicon roots of trust,
  automotive, mobile secure elements); NVIDIA Jetson Orin is one member of
  the edge-AI family, the way Sentinel-2 is one source of the Earth
  substrate.
- The **OS execution trace** (`emem.os_trace.v1`, verified by the
  `emem-trace` crate, pre-checkable at `POST /v1/trace_verify`) binds the
  device's emitted output inside a signed, chained record; the
  **trace-encodings registry** (`GET /v1/trace_encodings`) states which
  capture toolchains a segment may name and how each tracer's own
  integrity is established (the "trace of the trace"). The write gate on
  `POST /v1/attest_traced` admits a device fact only when its trace
  verifies and every fact's payload is bound in it.
**The address, which is the half that did not generalise.** Every fact is
keyed by `CanonicalKey { cell, band, tslot }` where `cell` is a cell64, a
quantisation of latitude and longitude, so for most of this protocol's
life a fact could only be recorded about a PLACE. A telescope's target, a
file at a commit, a table at a schema version and a model at a checkpoint
have no latitude, and no amount of signing machinery gives them one. The
record, the receipt and the token grammar were always neutral; the
address was not, and it is the part everything else hangs from.

Since 2026-08-11 each profile declares an `address_space`, and the
registry refuses to load a profile that is `active` on one this build
cannot key a fact by. `geo.cell64` is a place. `entity.cid` is a subject
that is not one, named by a scheme-tagged anchor rather than located: a
HEALPix pointing, a quantised orbital bucket, a commit. The anchor is
quantised on purpose, so two observers who disagree slightly about an
orbit resolve to one subject with two witnesses rather than two adjacent
records that contradiction scoring cannot compare.

The record layer turned out to already carry either, which is a test
rather than a claim: the canonical index holds a `String`, the receipt
preimage hashes cells as opaque length-prefixed strings, and the storage
key is their bytes. What is not built is the write path, so a device on a
non-geographic profile can prove how it ran and still have nowhere to put
the reading. That is why those five profiles are `candidate`.

- The evidence is citeable and resolvable: `emem:trace:<trace_cid>` and
  `emem:attestation:<attestation_cid>` (`POST /v1/trace_resolve`), and the
  resulting fact carries the `attested_execution` provenance class (§7).

**What is not open:** every device platform is `candidate` status, every
trust anchor is `provisional`, and device ingest is not enabled: the
registries, trace verifier, write gate, and tokens all ship, but no real
vendor anchor is pinned, so the gate admits no device yet. Authenticated
enrollment against published anchors and drift-anchor wiring are the
remaining work (§16). Location stays the first key for all of them.

### 10.3 Change attribution: what a readout change means

The §1.1 decomposition becomes concrete on this substrate. Take one cell,
one band, two tslots, and ask why the value moved.

- **Δ_encoder, pinned.** An embedding fact names its model checkpoint and
  its versioned recipe (`derivation.fn_key` in the content-addressed
  algorithm registry), so an encoder upgrade is a visible property of the
  record, never a silent shift that masquerades as change on the ground.
- **Δ_sensor and Δ_geo, recorded but not attributed.** Scene selection is
  signed into provenance (`scenes_tried`, the chosen scene id, the SCL
  cloud class), and the processing-baseline guard pins the upstream's
  radiometric convention. What was observed through is on the record; no
  computation splits its contribution out of a delta.
- **Δ_env against the rest.** The bi-temporal bounds (§4.3) keep "the
  world changed" and "the memory learned" as separate questions with
  separate answers.

What ships as change surfaces today, stated plainly: `emem_diff` returns
a raw delta (`nd.delta@1`); `state_diff` returns residual, L2, and cosine
between two vintages of one encoder. Neither attributes.

What ships as of 2026-07-16 is the LEDGER: `POST /v1/change_attribution`
(tool `emem_change_attribution`, registry key `change_attribution@1`)
returns per-term evidence for one cell, the observed Tessera
year-over-year change, the label-free index pairs with raw deltas, the
sources each visit was observed through, the encoder pinning proof, and
the scene-class per visit, every item carrying its fact cids under a
signed receipt, with `split` null and an in-band note saying why. The ledger
also persists: each run stores itself as a derivative fact (band
`change_attribution.ledger`, parents = every fact read) and returns its
`emem:fact:` token, so an attribution is cited and dereferenced like
any reading. What does not exist is the split itself: the estimator
and the calibrated cross-encoder, cross-sensor stability model it
needs are open work. The roadmap carries it.

## 11. The agent-discoverable surface

`emem-server` serves HTTP/REST and MCP JSON-RPC on one port (default
`0.0.0.0:5051`): **177 documented REST paths under `/v1/*`** (188 total
in OpenAPI) and **114 MCP tools (18 core, 96 extended)**.

Discovery on first contact:

```text
  1. GET  /.well-known/emem.json         responder pubkey + capabilities
  2. GET  /.well-known/mcp.json          MCP transport advertisement
  3. GET  /.well-known/agent-card.json   metadata, recommended tool order
  4. GET  /v1/manifests                  bands_cid, algorithms_cid,
                                         sources_cid, schema_cid,
                                         registry_cid, topics_cid
  5. GET  /v1/grid_info                  cell pitch, honest warnings
  6. GET  /v1/verifier_spec              the signing rules, code-generated
  7. POST /v1/locate {q:"<place>"}       -> cell64
  8. POST /v1/recall                     -> signed facts + receipt
```

### 11.1 MCP tools are not read-only

v1 of this document stated that MCP tools are a strict read-only subset
of REST and that writes go through REST only. That is false, and the
responder refutes it from its own annotations: **24 of 114 tools carry
`readOnlyHint: false`**. Five are destructive: `memory_create`,
`memory_str_replace`, `memory_insert`, `memory_delete`, `memory_rename`;
and eighteen are non-destructive writes, which is the number a reader is
most likely to find surprising: alongside the obvious `emem_entity`,
`emem_entity_link`, `emem_derive`, `emem_memory_bundle` and
`emem_memory_supersede`, it includes `emem_ask`, `emem_recall`,
`emem_backfill`, `emem_intent`, `emem_hunt`,
`emem_change_attribution` and the four raster/cube builders. Those answer
a question and PERSIST what they materialised to answer it, so asking is
a write here even though nothing was asked to be stored. An agent can
attest, mint an identity, and register a derivation over MCP without
touching REST.

These counts are computed from the registry rather than typed: the
previous revision said "8 of 108", which understated the write surface by
a factor of two and a half while making an argument about trust.

### 11.2 Tiering is a listing decision, not a capability decision

An MCP host loads every advertised descriptor into the model's context at
connect. All 102 cost about 243 KB of every conversation whether or not it
ever touches Earth observation, and a third party measured exactly that
and called it overhead. So `POST /mcp` advertises the 18 tools of the core
loop, about 40 KB, and `POST /mcp/full` advertises all 114.

Narrowing discovery removes no capability: **`tools/call` dispatches all
114 by name at either endpoint**, and an explicit
`{"tier":"core"|"extended"|"all"}` overrides the endpoint default. A tool
absent from a list is still callable. This matters because a tool an
agent cannot see is a tool it concludes does not exist, and the failure
mode of a 243 KB dump is the same conclusion reached for a different
reason: the agent stops reading.

`emem_tools` is itself core and maps the rest. With no arguments it
returns the core loop in order plus a bundle and shape menu in about 13
KB. `{"name":"emem_ndvi"}` returns one tool's input schema and a runnable
example in about 8 KB. `{"q":"ndvi"}` searches.

Every tool declares exactly one **shape** and any number of overlapping
**bundles** in MCP-standard `_meta`, as `dev.emem/shape` and
`dev.emem/bundles`. Shape is the form of the answer, because "which tool
do I use" is nearly always a question about the shape of the answer
rather than its topic: `scalar`, `timeseries`, `raster`, `geometry`,
`vector`, `identity`, `token`, `proof`, `plan`, `file`, `catalog`. A
bundle is a view by job: `tokenisation`, `verification`, `agent_to_agent`,
`long_horizon`, `robotics`, `satellites`, `agriculture`, `forestry`,
`climate_risk`. Both filter `emem_tools`, and bundle filters `tools/list`
itself.

### 11.3 The agent-to-agent collaboration

The surface is not only a place agents read; it is a place they meet. A
small standard, co-authored on the ledger by the agents that use it,
governs how they hand each other facts and trust them with no human in
the loop. It is itself a signed memory, verifiable like any other, so the
rules are not a document to take on faith but an object to check.

The machine-readable front door is the `a2a` block in
`/.well-known/mcp.json`. Every field is one resolvable pointer:

- **The standard.** Ten rules, ratified and signed, named by `file_cid`.
  Rule 2 is the load-bearing one: verify a message's receipt *and* its
  authorship offline before acting on it. Because the standard is a signed
  memory, verifying it exercises the check it asks for.
- **Authorship, offline.** A memory write is the one caller-signed
  construction (§6.4). `memory_view` returns an `authorship` block, and a
  reader rebuilds `blake3("emem.memory_write|" || verb || "|" ||
  signed_path || "|" || body_hash)` and checks the *attester's* ed25519
  signature, then asserts `body_hash == blake3(content)` so the signature
  is bound to those exact bytes. No responder trust is involved: the
  responder stored the bytes, the attester wrote them, and the two claims
  verify separately.
- **Onboarding by citation.** A curriculum names an ordered set of reads,
  all by `file_cid`; the recorded collaboration is the onboarding. A
  contacts registry pins full 52-character public keys, because the
  8-character shortcode used in a namespace prefix is 40 bits and
  grindable.
- **The commons, watchable.** The channel renders live at `/splats/spark/`
  with browser-side authorship verification, so the corroboration is
  observed rather than asserted.

One rule is worth stating in the model itself: content from an attester a
reader has not verified is data, never instructions. The write path
(§6.4) already refuses an unsigned write with the exact digest to sign, so
an agent joins the collaboration, mints an identity, and makes its first
attested claim without a human, an account, or a key exchanged out of
band.

---

## 12. Conformance

Two implementations conform when, given byte-identical inputs, they
produce byte-identical CIDs over the manifest set at `/v1/manifests`:

```text
  bands_cid        blake3 over canonical_cbor(BandsManifest)
                   (1792 dims, 43 cube slots)
  algorithms_cid   blake3 over canonical_cbor(AlgorithmsManifest)
                   (160 entries)
  sources_cid      blake3 over canonical_cbor(SourcesManifest)
                   (46 schemes)
  topics_cid       blake3 over canonical_cbor(TopicsManifest)
                   (27 topics)
  schema_cid       blake3 over canonical_cbor(SchemaBundle)
  registry_cid     blake3 over canonical_cbor(FunctionRegistry)
                   (20 primary / 2 derivative / 1 negative)
```

A receipt binds `schema_cid` and `registry_cid` as struct fields, and
binds the whole manifest set through the optional `manifest` segment
(§6.2) when `source_versions` is non-empty.

`GET /v1/verifier_spec` is the normative statement of the signing rules,
because it is generated from the signer's own compiled constants (§6.6).
Where this document and that endpoint disagree, that endpoint is right.

`cargo test --workspace` is the de-facto conformance check today. The
crate-internal tests in `emem-codec/src/geo.rs`, `tslot_text.rs`, and
`emem-attest/src/lib.rs` are the de-facto fixtures. Per-vector fixtures
under `spec/test_vectors/` are not yet extracted, and until they are,
"conformance" means "passes our tests", which is weaker than the word
implies.

---

## 13. Privacy

Four `PrivacyClass` variants (`crates/emem-core/src/privacy.rs`):
**Public** for open-data bands; **AggregateOnly { min_res }**, where
population-density bands snap to a coarser resolution and the receipt
carries `privacy_snapped: true`; **L2OnlyWithModelCid**, for
fine-resolution embeddings tied to a specific model checkpoint, which L1
responders must refuse; and **Prohibited**, reserved, declared by no band
today.

Legal surface, cited in SPEC.md §13: GDPR (Reg 2016/679), UK-GDPR,
DPDP-2023, CCPA-CPRA, RFC 9116. The canonical responder logs
`agent_ip_hash = base32_nopad_lower(blake3(client_ip)[..8])` rather than
the raw address. POST bodies are not captured. GET query strings are
captured for the 30-day journald retention window, which means a place
name in a query string is retained for 30 days and a place name in a POST
body is not.

---

## 14. Honest limits

Collected rather than scattered, because a limit mentioned once in
passing is a limit a reader misses.

### 14.1 What a signature does not mean

The signature proves who attested a record and that the bytes have not
changed. It does not make the value true, correct, current, or complete.
Confidence, uncertainty, and provenance travel with the value precisely
because the signature speaks to none of them.

### 14.2 Identity and tokens

- **Entity mints and links are not signed over their content.** The
  receipt binds the primitive and the cell, not the `entity_cid`, label,
  kind, or aliases. `intent` is a body field, never a preimage segment.
- **`emem:entity:` does not dereference to byte-identical bytes.** The
  identifier covers a narrow identity preimage; label, geometry, and (in
  the external-anchor branch) `cell64` sit outside it, so two nodes may
  hold different bodies under one identifier. There is no entity analogue
  of the fact cell-binding check.
- **No entity merge, and links do not conflict.** One alias maps to a
  growing candidate list with no precedence and no contradiction signal.
  Anyone may link any phrase to any entity: the endpoint takes no
  attester.
- **`entity_resolve` is an exact normalized-string lookup**, not a fuzzy
  or semantic match, and its candidates are unranked despite the tool
  description's wording.
- **`emem:cell:` does not dereference at all.** It is composed and never
  parsed.
- **`bundle_cid` is not a CBOR digest** (§3.5), and the family carries
  three identifier widths: 52 characters for a `fact_cid`, 26 for an
  `entity_cid` and a `bundle_cid`.
- **The responder does not re-verify a digest on read.** A client can
  detect a substituted body by recomputing the CID; the responder does
  not do it for them.

### 14.3 The transparency log

- **Not RFC 6962 conformant.** RFC 6962's tree construction with
  BLAKE3-256 substituted for SHA-256. No CT tooling interoperates.
- **It proves append-only-ness only to a client that pinned an earlier
  STH and returns.** A first-contact client has no baseline.
- **It does not resist split-view equivocation** (§8.3). No gossip
  exists; every artefact is served by the accused party.
- **Witness co-signing is scaffolding**: one witness, stale, no
  allowlist, no independence guarantee, self-submittable (§8.5).
- **The receipt does not chain to the log** (§8.4). You cannot prove a
  fact you were served is in it.
- **It cannot prove completeness.** A responder that never appends logs
  nothing, and the log cannot prove absence or non-omission.

### 14.4 Provenance

- **The class is an editorial per-band declaration**, never checked
  against the fact. `deterministic: true` means the band is *declared*
  recomputable, not that the value *was* recomputed.
- **`bands_cid` attests the table, not the classification's correctness**,
  and the manifest segment is optional, so some receipts are unbound.
- **Per-band, not per-fact**: a `deterministic_index` computed over a
  cloud-contaminated pixel keeps its class.
- **The caution is not universal per fact**: fan-out endpoints hoist band
  metadata to the response root at default verbosity.
- **The ontology is compile-time embedded.** The documented hot-swap does
  not exist.

### 14.5 Substrate and grid

- **Cells are not equal-area.** Square at the equator, taller than wide
  above it: longitude pitch narrows with cos(lat), so a cell at 60° is
  about 9.54 m by 4.77 m. The equal-area hex DGGS is a spec target, not
  this build.
- **The address is not token-economical.** A cell64 measures 12.5 BPE
  tokens (cl100k_base, mean over 14 live cells; 12.1 under o200k_base),
  against 8.5 for H3 at a comparable pitch and 7.5 to 8.0 for a geohash
  or a hex S2 id. The alphabet was designed for adjacency, not for a
  tokenizer, and no BPE vocabulary was trained on it, so each of the four
  bigrams fragments. A tokenizer-aware alphabet under a new mode prefix
  would fix it without moving existing addresses, and is not built. Until
  then the grid costs about 50% more context than H3 while also not being
  equal-area, so on the two axes a reader would compare it against a DGGS
  on, it currently loses both.
- **Sub-metre imagery.** None. Sentinel-2 at 10 m is the finest pitch
  served.
- **Edge and onboard inference.** All inference is in-tenant. No
  spacecraft-bus encoder firmware ships with the protocol.
- **Federation.** Single primary; replicas are read-only. No
  multi-host clustering, no SOC 2 attestation.
- **Declared is not wired.** 46 declared source schemes is a catalog
  count, not a capability count, and several schemes remain
  declared-but-unwired.
- **The learned dynamics head is retired.** Earlier versions served
  `jepa_predict_v2`, a head trained on synthetic sequences that did not beat
  persistence on real NDVI (skill -0.064). The route is gone; receipts it
  signed still verify.
- **Cold region fetch has a ceiling, and it fails silently.** A region
  read whose bands are not yet materialized pays the upstream fetch per
  cell, about 1.2 s for `forest_change.lossyear`, and past roughly 250
  cells the request crosses the gateway timeout and returns HTTP 504
  carrying nothing a caller can act on: no partial rows, no cursor, no
  statement of cause. Warm reads are unaffected; 756 cells of NDVI answer
  normally, so this is a cold-fetch wall, not a size wall. It is also the
  odd one out on this surface. `cells_in_bbox` caps at 1024 cells and says
  so loudly, with an explicit truncation marker, a continuation cursor and
  a next step, which is the shape the fetch path should have and does not.
  A `budget_ms` that returns partial results with a stated miss count,
  plus an async bulk path for cold bands over a region, is specified and
  not built. Until it is, chunk cold-band region reads under about 120
  cells. This is the single failure on the read surface where the caller
  learns nothing, and it blocks the base case it matters most for: an EUDR
  assessment over a whole plantation.
- **The change-attribution split does not exist.** The ledger ships
  (§10.3): per-term evidence with fact cids under a signed receipt. But
  `emem_diff` and `state_diff` still return raw deltas, and nothing
  decomposes a delta numerically into
  environment, sensor, geometry, and encoder terms.

### 14.5b Where the differentiator actually appears

Stated here because §14 is where a reader looks for what this protocol
does NOT buy, and the honest answer changed shape when it was measured
twice.

An independent consumer measured a single agent answering questions
against several memory architectures, on two unrelated sites, scoring by
whether an error would change a business decision rather than by exact
bytes. Four architectures, including free lexical retrieval, produced
**zero** business-material failures. At decision-impact thresholds, on
that task, **the memory architecture barely mattered**. That result
replicated, and it does not support an accuracy claim for addressing.

The same author then measured a **handoff**: agent A surveys an area,
hands agent B one artefact, B answers from it, A never speaks to B, so
the artefact is the only variable.

| handoff format     | med drift | MAX drift | med err | MAX err | unlocatable |
|--------------------|----------:|----------:|--------:|--------:|------------:|
| bundle token       |     0.0 m |     0.0 m |   0.00% |    0.0% |        0/20 |
| individual tokens  |     0.0 m |     0.0 m |   0.00% |   25.3% |        6/20 |
| A's own summary    |        --  |       --  |  14.03% |   96.0% |       17/20 |
| BM25 over A's dump |     0.0 m |     0.0 m |   0.00% |    0.0% |        0/20 |
| dense over A's dump|     0.0 m |   100.4 m |   2.48% |   14.8% |        6/20 |

**Final numbers, 2026-07-23, after the long run completed and the scorer
was audited.** Across 599 turns and 9,318 steps on eight worlds, the
separation is in CITABILITY and it is structural rather than a matter of
degree: `emem_bundle` 100% citable and 100% within 1% (n=1624), `context`
98% citable, `emem_token` 98%. The arms that must LOCATE the value rather
than being handed it: `rag_bm25` is **0% citable** while 35% land within
1% (median error 22.5%), and `context_region` 21% citable, 22% within 1%
(median error 40.7%). A retrieved chunk can carry the right number and
still be uncitable, because it is not a signed reference. That is the
finding this protocol can defend.

And the honest frame around it, which is larger than the result.
Scored across the whole corpus by Wilson 95% interval overlap rather than
point estimates, every head-to-head is **1 emem win, 16 ties, 0 losses** (after a scorer audit found four bugs and moved every count).
The one win is `emem_bundle` 99.6% against plain `context` 98.1%
byte-identical at n=1552: 1.5 percentage points, and that is the entire
measured accuracy advantage of addressing in this corpus. **46 of 72
comparisons were excluded, 42 because the emem arm was handed the answer
verbatim** while the comparator had to find it, which is a tautology and
not a memory-architecture result; before that exclusion the board read 23
wins and its author called it worthless. Zero losses is a weakness of the
evidence, not a strength of emem: the one measured loss (a relay where
`emem_token` scored 9/10 against a bare number's 10/10) lost its data
before writing and is re-running, and the relay separations are
underpowered at n=8, where 38% against 0% is a TIE.

Reported as a distribution rather than a pass/fail flag, at the benchmark
author's insistence, because a threshold is not a deployment number.
**Medians hide the failures that cost money.** Every format above is
acceptable on a median; two are acceptable on the tail. The paraphrase's
worst answer is wrong by 96%, and 17 of its 20 answers correspond to no
cell in the surveyed region at all: it is not misreporting a neighbour,
it is producing numbers that exist nowhere in what it was handed. Dense
retrieval passes a value-only threshold while answering from cells up to
100 m away, which its author published as a limit of their own metric
rather than of the retriever.

The paraphrase is the only format that fails materially, at 41%. The
bundle token is the only arm that is simultaneously byte-exact and
materially perfect; the retrieval arms deliver the right value and
nothing citeable.

So the claim this protocol can defend is narrow and specific: **buy
addressing for the handoff and for auditability, not for accuracy.** A
single agent with a good retriever is fine. The failure appears when one
agent must hand its findings to another and the natural artefact to hand
over is a summary, whose losses are invisible to both parties because
the summary reads perfectly well and the receiver cannot know what was
dropped.

One bound the same author placed on their own retrieval numbers, which
also bounds ours: dense retrieval missed the target cell 12 of 20 times
here and was **materially correct every time**, because a neighbouring
cell in a spatially autocorrelated field carries nearly the same value.
The cost of a retrieval miss is therefore a property of the DATA, not of
the retriever, and no retrieval comparison in this work, including the
BM25-beats-dense result, generalises past corpora whose neighbours differ
sharply in value.

Limits, as its author attached them: 20 handoffs per arm, two models on
one host, one area type, 2026-07-22. Nobody outside that collaboration
has replicated it. And the arm most favourable to this protocol was
re-scored **down** by its author before publication, from 12/20 material
to 2/20, after they traced the discrepancy to a truncation in their own
harness; that error had been running against this protocol.

### 14.6 Specification

- **"Canonical CBOR" here is not RFC 8949 canonical.** Struct keys are in
  declaration order and are not sorted (§5). A generic canonical encoder
  computes the wrong digest.
- **Conformance means "passes our tests".** Per-vector fixtures are not
  yet extracted.

A request that names a missing surface returns a typed Absence or a
structured error code. No surface returns `verdict=false` for an absent
capability.

---

## 15. Comparison with adjacent work

**Certificate Transparency (RFC 6962).** The direct ancestor of §8, and
the comparison flatters CT. CT has an operating network of independent
logs, monitors, and auditors, plus gossip proposals to close split view.
emem borrows the tree construction, substitutes BLAKE3-256, and has one
stale witness. The mechanism is homage; the ecosystem is absent.

**Content-addressed stores (IPFS, IPLD, Git).** The `cid = hash(bytes)`
idea is theirs, and emem's fact layer is a conventional instance of it.
What differs is that emem addresses a *place and a time* as well as
bytes: `(cell, band, tslot)` is a canonical key that lets two parties who
have never met arrive at the same address for the same observable without
exchanging a CID first. A pure content store cannot answer "what is the
elevation here" because "here" is not a hash.

**Spatial indexes (H3, S2, geohash).** Peers to §4, and H3 is the
declared migration target. cell64 is a packed 64-bit lat/lng
quantisation. Earlier drafts justified it as a trade, worse than H3 on
equal-area properties and better on token economy; the second half does
not survive measurement. At a comparable pitch a cell64 costs 12.5 BPE
tokens (cl100k_base, n=14 live cells) against 8.5 for H3 r12, 7.5 to 8.0
for a 10-character geohash and 7.5 to 8.0 for a hex S2 id, so cell64 is
the most expensive of the four in the unit a language model pays in, and
it is not equal-area either. What it does buy is decode-free locality:
adjacent codepoints are adjacent cells, so prefix comparison is a spatial
operation on the string, and the address is a self-describing 64-bit
integer with no library needed to parse it. Whether that is worth 4 extra
tokens per address is not settled by anything measured here, and the
honest statement is that the grid is a cost the protocol currently pays,
not an advantage it holds. §4 and §14.5 carry the numbers.

**Agent memory frameworks (MemGPT, CoALA, vector stores).** The kind
taxonomy in §Abstract is CoALA's. The difference is verifiability: a
vector store returns what it holds and asks to be believed. emem returns
a receipt, and the receiver checks it without trusting the store. The
cost is that emem cannot do similarity over arbitrary prose, which a
vector store does well; `find_similar` operates over declared band
embeddings, not over free text.

**Geospatial data platforms (Earth Engine, Planetary Computer, STAC).**
These are the incumbents for the substrate in §10 and are better at it:
deeper catalogs, real compute, mature tooling. None of them issues a
signed receipt that a third party can check offline, and none gives an
agent a token that another agent can dereference to identical bytes. emem
is not competing on catalog depth; it is adding an identity and trust
layer that the catalogs do not have.

## 16. Changes from v1

v1 is archived unedited at [/whitepaper/v1](/whitepaper/v1). It remains
the version cited by the DOI. This section exists so a reader of v1 can
see exactly which of its claims this responder does not honour, rather
than discovering it through a failed signature.

### 16.1 Claims v1 made that were false or became false

| v1 said | The code does |
|---|---|
| §1, §4: "Every CID is `base32_nopad_lower(blake3(canonical_cbor)[..16])`" and `FactCid = ...[..16]` | A `fact_cid` is **not truncated**: it is the full 32-byte blake3 digest, base32-encoded to **52** characters. The `[..16]` rule (26 characters) is what `entity_cid` and `bundle_cid` use. An implementation following v1 computes a 26-character identifier that can never match a real `fact_cid`. This is the most consequential of v1's errors: it breaks content addressing itself. |
| §5.2: the receipt preimage is a `\|`-joined concatenation of `request_id`, `served_at`, `primitive`, `cells`, `fact_cids` | That is the **v0** rule. Every new receipt is signed under **preimage v1**: domain-separated, every segment tagged and length-prefixed (§6.1). v0 is retained for verification only, so pre-cutover receipts still verify. |
| §5.2: "the `as_of` block sits outside the preimage ... does not change the signature math" | `as_of` **is** a tagged segment (`0x04`) and **is** signed (§6.2). |
| §5.2.1: `body_hash = blake3(canonical request body bytes)` | The responder never hashes the request body. `body_hash` is **per-verb** (§6.4). A client implementing v1's rule cannot produce an acceptable signature. |
| §15: "MCP tools are a strict read-only subset of REST; writes go through REST only" | **24 of 114 MCP tools write** (§11.1), including the five memory verbs, `emem_entity`, `emem_entity_link`, and `emem_derive`. |
| §15: 93 documented REST paths under `/v1/*` (96 total), 92 MCP tools (10 core, 71 extended) | **108** under `/v1/*` (**112** total), **91** tools (**14** core, **77** extended). |

### 16.2 Claims in v1's supporting material this document withdraws

These were not in v1's body but circulated in the README, module
headers, page copy, and tool descriptions alongside it. They are listed
because withdrawing a claim quietly is how the original error propagates.
Each has been corrected at its source as of this document's date; the
entries below record what was claimed, not what is still claimed.

- "An RFC 6962 Merkle tree." It is RFC 6962's **construction** with
  BLAKE3-256 (§8.1).
- "A responder cannot tell two clients two different histories." It can
  (§8.3).
- "With witness co-signing", read as an operating property. It is a
  callable endpoint with one stale participant (§8.5).
- "The text to canonical-id resolution decision is itself signed and
  citeable." It is not (§2.4).
- Any token "resolves to the byte-identical signed object", applied
  across the family. True for `emem:fact:`, false for `emem:entity:`,
  vacuous for `emem:cell:` (§3).
- "Four provenance classes." There are **six**; `attested_execution` is
  the device-substrate class (§7, §10.2) and `unclassified` is the
  fail-safe default.
- "Hot-swap the ontology without recompiling." The ontology is compiled
  in (§10.1).
- "`pip install ememdev`", presented as a working install path. Every
  wheel published to PyPI (0.0.9, 0.1.0, 1.0.0) contained no Python
  modules; the roadmap's SDK entry carries the full account and the
  release gates that now prevent a repeat.
- "46 declared sources and 124 wired measurements", read together as one
  capability count. Declared is a catalog count and several schemes remain
  unwired (§14.5); the README now scopes the two numbers apart.
- The homepage FAQ listing three foundation-model embeddings where the
  substrate then wired four (Clay was omitted). The page is compiled into the
  binary, so that correction lands with the next server deploy rather
  than with this document.
- "base-1024 bigrams", which appeared in 14 places including the OpenAPI
  `Cell64` schema, where the same sentence went on to call the alphabet
  65,536-entry. The alphabet has **65,536** entries; four base-1024 digits
  would encode 40 bits and could not address a 64-bit cell (§4.1). Corrected
  everywhere as of this document's date.

### 16.3 What is new since v1

The entity registry and the token grammar (§2, §3); tamper-provenance
classes (§7); the transparency log and witness endpoints (§8);
caller-registered derivations (§9); the preimage v0 to v1 cutover (§6.3);
MCP tiering, shapes, and bundles (§11.2); and the code-generated verifier
spec (§6.6).

### 16.4 Why v1 rotted, and what changed

v1's counts were correct when written. They decayed because a number
re-typed into prose has no owner: nothing failed when a tool landed and
the paragraph did not move. Three of its five false claims are of that
kind. The other two, the preimage and the body-hash rules, decayed
because the protocol improved and the prose did not follow.

Two mechanisms now exist that did not. `GET /v1/verifier_spec` is
generated from the signer's compiled constants, so the normative
description of the signing rules cannot drift from the code that signs
(§6.6). And `scripts/sync_counts.py` verifies every count in this
repository against the live responder and the registries, failing rather
than warning.

Neither mechanism protects prose like this sentence. That is why §12
makes the machine-readable spec normative where it and this document
disagree, and why this document tries to state mechanisms rather than
totals wherever a total would do.

## 17. Open questions

- **Chain the receipt to the log.** A `fact_cid -> leaf_index` index and
  a log segment in the receipt preimage would close §8.4 and make
  "transparency" mean what it sounds like. This is the single highest-value
  increment on this substrate.
- **The change-attribution split.** The §10.3 ledger ships and persists
  as a derivative fact; the numeric split needs an estimator and a
  calibrated cross-encoder, cross-sensor stability model. The output
  shape is settled; the attribution logic is not.
- **An operating witness network.** Independent witnesses, a published
  trust policy, a refresh cadence, and gossip between clients. Until
  then, §8.5 stands.
- **Sign the entity decision.** An `intent` (or `object_cid`) segment in
  the preimage would make the mint and alias claims in §2.4 true rather
  than aspirational.
- **Per-fact provenance.** The class is per-band (§7.2). Per-fact lineage
  would let a cloud-contaminated index declare itself.
- **Extracted test vectors.** `spec/test_vectors/` would turn §12's
  "passes our tests" into conformance a second implementation can claim.
- **H3 migration.** Equal-area cells under a new mode prefix; receipts
  pin the active manifest CIDs, so historical answers do not drift.
- **Entity reconciliation.** A merge primitive, and a contradiction
  signal for conflicting links (§2.4).
- **Typed identity kinds.** An entity's `kind` is free text (§2.3). A
  small closed set (physical, material, ecological, functional,
  administrative) is the prerequisite for saying what kind of thing
  changed at an address, not only that something did.
