# emem as long-term memory: integration matrix

emem is a Streamable-HTTP MCP server. Any host that speaks MCP can use it
as a long-term, planet-keyed memory tier without an SDK install, an API
key, or a per-tenant signup. The same handlers also answer plain REST at
`/openapi.json`, so non-MCP runtimes wire in equally well.

This page is a one-page rosetta stone: per runtime, the smallest possible
config that turns emem into the long-term memory layer for an agent that
already exists, plus a pointer to a runnable example in this repository.

## State vectors

The state of a place as one fixed-width `vector: Vec<f32>`, every wired
band at its canonical offset, with `coverage[]` saying which slots are
measured, signed-absent, or not yet fetched. The vector's own content id
is `state_cid`; the handle an agent passes on is an `emem:bundle:` over
the facts it cites.

```bash
curl -sX POST https://emem.dev/v1/state \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"cell":"South Mumbai","view":"cube"}'
```

Response shape:

```json
{
  "cell":          "defi.zb4d7.zb8ec.zf21e",
  "view":          "cube",
  "dim":           1792,
  "vector":        [0.0, 0.0, ... ],
  "filled_bands":  0,
  "missing_bands": 41,
  "coverage":      [{"key": "overture", "offset": 128, "dims": 64, "status": "missing"}, ...],
  "state_cid":     "<52 chars base32-nopad-lowercase>",
  "memory_token":  "",
  "hint":          "all cube slots are cold at this cell ... pass materialize: true",
  "receipt":       { /* signed ed25519 over canonical blake3 preimage */ }
}
```

Inputs:

- `cell` may be a cell64 string or a free-text place name (resolved
  through the standard geocoder cascade; the `resolved_from` field
  reports which layer answered).
- `materialize: true` fetches every cold slot (about 30 upstream calls
  on a cold cell); `/v1/recall` with a narrow `bands` list warms only the
  slots you need.
- `view: "encoder"` reads one vector band. emem.dev has retired its
  foundation encoders (Tessera, Clay, Prithvi, Galileo): facts they
  signed still read and verify, and nothing new materialises, so a cell
  without one answers 404 saying so.

Use sites:

| Use site                           | What the vector is doing                                                |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LLM context prefix                 | A numerical fingerprint of "what is here" the model can attend over     |
| Input to `/v1/find_similar`        | The query vector for k-NN over the geotessera index                     |
| Change detection                   | Diff two vintages of `/v1/state` for the same cell to spot land change  |
| Cross-encoder bridge               | Pass the vector to a ridge-regression bridge into another encoder space |
| Long-term agent memory             | Cache the vector under a user/intent key; recall byte-identically later |

## Memory tokens

The fastest way to hand one signed fact at one place to any agent, any
runtime, any host, is a memory token: a single colon-separated string
that parses back into a cell and a fact CID.

```
emem:fact:<cell64>:<fact_cid>
```

The pre-rename prefixes `memt:`, `memb:`, and `meme:` still resolve.

A canonical token, copy-pasteable, resolves to the South Mumbai
elevation example used throughout this site:

```
emem:fact:defi.zb4d7.ze56c.zf24c:4qakixs4xcax3bm2ntlw6ue47bvg4ry5wwa7oog4h6kfp7lvk5ma
```

### Compose

```bash
curl -sX POST https://emem.dev/v1/memory_token \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "cell":     "defi.zb4d7.ze56c.zf24c",
    "fact_cid": "4qakixs4xcax3bm2ntlw6ue47bvg4ry5wwa7oog4h6kfp7lvk5ma"
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "memory_token": "emem:fact:defi.zb4d7.ze56c.zf24c:4qakixs4xcax3bm2ntlw6ue47bvg4ry5wwa7oog4h6kfp7lvk5ma",
  "cell":         "defi.zb4d7.ze56c.zf24c",
  "fact_cid":     "4qakixs4xcax3bm2ntlw6ue47bvg4ry5wwa7oog4h6kfp7lvk5ma",
  "grammar":      "emem:fact:<cell64>:<fact_cid>",
  "docs":         "/whitepaper.md#3-the-token-grammar"
}
```

Composition is offline. Agents can mint tokens client-side; the
endpoint is the single source of truth for the grammar and a
convenience round-trip.

### Resolve

The third segment of a token is the fact CID. To pull the signed bytes:

```bash
curl -sS https://emem.dev/v1/facts/4qakixs4xcax3bm2ntlw6ue47bvg4ry5wwa7oog4h6kfp7lvk5ma
```

That returns the canonical CBOR (or JSON when you ask for it) of the
fact. The CID is self-certifying:
`blake3(canonical_cbor(fact)) == base32_decode(fact_cid)` (52 base32 chars, the full 32-byte digest). A
man-in-the-middle that swaps a different fact for the same CID is
detected by the digest check.

### Where to use a memory token

| Use site                            | What the token is doing                                         |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inside an LLM prompt                | Cite-handle the model can echo as the source of a number        |
| Tool-call argument                  | Single string the receiving tool parses + resolves              |
| Agent-to-agent message              | Handshake artefact that prevents downstream disagreement        |
| Log line, audit trail               | Forensic anchor a future debugger can replay byte-identically   |
| Long-term memory store              | Stable key the runtime caches once, dereferences on demand      |

### Use with mem0 / LangGraph / mem-style runtimes

The general pattern: cache the memory token in your runtime's
long-term memory store keyed by user intent or task subject. On the
next session, fetch the token from your store and resolve it via
`GET /v1/facts/<fact_cid>` to get byte-identical bytes back. No
embedding lookup, no similarity search, no drift.

```python
# pseudocode. Works in any LangGraph / mem0 / AutoGen / similar
# runtime that ships a long-term-memory tier.
user_intent = "track elevation of South Mumbai over time"
token = client.recall_then_memory_token(place="South Mumbai", band="copdem30m.elevation_mean")
long_term_memory.set(user_intent, token)

# next session: same byte-identical fact.
token = long_term_memory.get(user_intent)
fact  = client.resolve_memory_token(token)  # GET /v1/facts/<cid>
print(fact["value"], fact["unit"])  # 10.0 m above mean sea level
```

The contract: the token survives the conversation that minted it. Two
agents on two hosts pass the token between them and pull the same
bytes from any emem responder that ever held the fact.

### Parse rules

```
parts    = token.split(":", 3)
assert parts[0] == "emem" and parts[1] == "fact"
cell64   = parts[2]
fact_cid = parts[3]

Legacy memt: tokens keep the old three-part shape (memt:<cell64>:<fact_cid>) and still resolve.
```

The outer separator is `:`. Neither `cell64` nor `fact_cid` may contain
`:` (the compose endpoint rejects). The full grammar, dereference
path, and named failure modes (`malformed`, `cid_not_found`, drift on
re-encode) are in [`/whitepaper.md#3-the-token-grammar`](whitepaper-v2.md#3-the-token-grammar).

## Memory bundles

A bundle composes N facts at N places into one signed envelope. The
token grammar is `emem:bundle:<bundle_cid>` (parallel to `emem:fact:`). Bundles
fit the "task done, here are the citations I used" pattern: the agent
hands one token to the next caller, who pulls every cited fact in one
round-trip.

```bash
curl -sX POST https://emem.dev/v1/memory_bundle \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "triples": [
      {"cell":"defi.zb4d7.ze56c.zf24c","band":"copdem30m.elevation_mean"},
      {"cell":"defi.zb4d7.ze56c.zf24c","band":"surface_water.recurrence"},
      {"cell":"defi.zb4d7.ze56c.zf24c","band":"hansen.loss_year"}
    ],
    "purpose":"flood-risk site assessment 2026-05"
  }' | jq '.bundle_token'
# "emem:bundle:ugubgeza3bcj2mjfpkg6bvgjga"

curl -sX GET https://emem.dev/v1/memory_bundle/emem:bundle:ugubgeza3bcj2mjfpkg6bvgjga | jq .
```

`bundle_cid` is deterministic across responders: the same triples in
the same order produce the same `bundle_cid` everywhere. Any peer
that holds the underlying facts can resolve the bundle.

## Memory files: the agent's writable scratchpad

The substrate exposes six file-op verbs that conform to Anthropic's
memory-tool spec (header `context-management-2025-06-27`). The
"files" live at paths under `/memories/`, are content-addressed
(each write produces a `file_cid`), and ed25519-signed under the
responder's identity. Any MCP host that uses Anthropic's memory tool
can point at emem and get signed, replayable, federated memory for
free.

```jsonc
// Write
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{
  "name":"emem_memory_create",
  "arguments":{
    "path":"/memories/runbook/2026-05-28.md",
    "file_text":"Mount Fuji elevation 3776 m via Cop-DEM, no surface water in 5 km buffer.",
    "kind":"episodic"
  }
}}

// Search semantically over file contents (BGE + Lance)
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{
  "name":"emem_memory_search",
  "arguments":{"q":"elevation observations at Japanese mountains","k":3}
}}

// Stream every write as it happens (SSE)
GET /v1/memory/sse?path_prefix=/memories/runbook/&kind=episodic
```

`kind` carries the CoALA taxonomy: `episodic` for observations,
`semantic` for durable facts, `procedural` for playbooks, `resource`
for generic scratchpads (default). `emem_memory_list_by_kind` returns
only the slice the agent asked for, sorted by `signed_at` desc.

### Capability binding (multi-agent integration)

Send an `attester` block on every write. A release responder refuses
unattested writes to *any* path by default with 401
`memory_attestation_required`, and `emem.dev` runs that way, so signing
is the normal path rather than a multi-agent extra. It also gives each
agent its own namespace:

```jsonc
{"name":"emem_memory_create","arguments":{
  "path":"/memories/by_attester/wosdtqio/note.md",
  "file_text":"...",
  "kind":"episodic",
  "attester":{
    "pubkey_b32":"wosdtqio...",
    "sig_b32":"ed25519 signature over blake3(\"emem.memory_write|create|<path>|<body_hash>\")"
  }
}}
```

The responder verifies the signature before persisting; an invalid
sig returns 401 `memory_attestation_invalid`, a wrong-namespace
write returns 403 `memory_namespace_violation`. `<body_hash>` is
blake3 over the content the verb produces: the `file_text` for
`create`, the whole file after the edit for `str_replace` and
`insert`, `blake3("")` for `delete`. `rename` signs over the
`new_path` with the `old_path` as its body, so one signature covers
both ends of the move. Reference implementation in
`crates/emem-primitives/src/memory_acl.rs`: `attester_preimage()`,
`rename_body_hash()`, `verify_attester()`. The same shape works
across LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI multi-agent flows: each agent
gets a stable identity, every action is signed by that identity,
and `memory_contradictions` surfaces disagreement between agents
on the same `(cell, band, tslot)`.

### Bi-temporal queries (audit + replay)

Every read primitive accepts `as_of_tslot` (what the world looked
like on a date) and `as_of_signed_at` (what emem knew on a date).
The receipt carries an `as_of` block when the bound is set, so an
auditor in year *t+k* replays a year-*t* query byte-for-byte:

```bash
curl -sX POST https://emem.dev/v1/recall \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"cell":"defi.zb4d7.ze56c.zf24c","bands":["copdem30m.elevation_mean"],"as_of_signed_at":"2026-05-01T00:00:00Z"}' \
  | jq '.receipt.as_of'
# {"transaction_time":"2026-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
```

This pattern is what powers EUDR DDS audits (cite forest baseline
as of submission date), insurance underwriting (cite evidence as of
bind date), and EU AI Act Article 12 logging (verifiable evidence
trail to a regulator who never trusted the operator).

Any host that speaks MCP reaches the same 114 tools at the same URL, whether or
not it has a row here: the endpoint is `https://emem.dev/mcp` and reads need no
key. The rows above are the ones with a checked-in example. Where a host has no
native Streamable HTTP transport, the `mcp-remote` stdio bridge covers it, and
that is the only reason a runtime would need anything emem-specific at all.

Reads are idempotent. Retry on 5xx; treat 4xx as permanent. Each cold-band
materialiser is capped at 14 s (`EMEM_MATERIALIZER_TIMEOUT_SECS`, code default
and the hosted setting), and the gateway budget is 180 s. This line said 30 s
per upstream for as long as it existed; the cap was lowered to 14 s so that one
slow upstream could not spend the whole `/v1/ask` budget and return an empty
envelope. Re-derive both from `crates/emem-api-rest/src/lib.rs`
(`materializer_timeout_secs`) rather than trusting this sentence.

## Physical-world guardrails, in whatever you already run

Every runtime above can ground a claim. Fewer can tell you when one of its own
claims stopped being true. That is a separate call, and it is deliberately not
tied to any vendor's product.

Two ways to use it, and the difference is who is in the request path.

**Consult it.** `POST https://emem.dev/v1/guard/verdict` answers what a guard
would say, over emem's own corpus. It is advisory: nothing is blocked, and this
responder sits in nobody's path. MCP tool `emem_guard_verdict`, core tier.

**Enforce it.** Run `emem-guard` yourself. No account here, no key from us: it
generates its own signing key and appends every verdict to a log anyone can
audit offline. `curl -s https://emem.dev/v1/guard/selfhost | jq -r .skill`, or
the MCP tool `emem_guard_selfhost`.

### The same question, from five different clients

`?shape=` exists so you never reshape a payload to ask. Post the body your
framework already produced.

```bash
# Anything that can make an HTTP request.
curl -sS -X POST https://emem.dev/v1/guard/verdict \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"texts":["Canopy height in Sumatra reached 31 m on 2026-08-05."]}'
```

```python
# Any OpenAI-compatible client, including local runtimes and gateways.
# Note the path: it is deliberately NOT /v1/moderations, because this
# checks grounding and detects no content-safety category at all.
import httpx
r = httpx.post("https://emem.dev/v1/guard/verdict?shape=openai",
               json={"input": draft_text}).json()
if r["results"][0]["flagged"]:
    print(r["results"][0]["emem"]["reason"])
```

```python
# LangChain / LangGraph / LlamaIndex / CrewAI / AutoGen: they all hand you a
# message list eventually. Send it as it is.
httpx.post("https://emem.dev/v1/guard/verdict",
           json={"messages": [m.dict() for m in state["messages"]]})
```

```javascript
// An MCP proxy, gating a tool call before it runs. On a deny the response
// carries `result`, already shaped as a CallToolResult with isError set:
// substitute it and the model reads the denial where it reads errors.
const v = await fetch("https://emem.dev/v1/guard/verdict?shape=mcp", {
  method: "POST", headers: {"content-type": "application/json"},
  body: JSON.stringify(jsonRpcRequest),
}).then(r => r.json());
if (!v.allow) return v.result;
```

```bash
# An OPA-compatible policy client, or Envoy external authorisation.
curl -sS -X POST 'https://emem.dev/v1/guard/verdict?shape=policy' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input":{"prompt":"...","tool":"publish"}}'
# -> {"result":{"allow":true,"deny":[]}}
```

CloudEvents 1.0 works the same way with `?shape=cloudevent`, so a Knative,
Dapr or Argo Events mesh routes an agent's output through the check with no
adapter written on your side.

### Reading the answer

```
EMEM-GUARD DENY PROV_BYTES token=emem:fact:<cell>:<cid> fix=remove_reference leaf=-
```

Branch on `fix`, not on the prose. `refresh_token` means re-resolve and retry.
`remove_reference` means the citation cannot be made to verify. `contact_admin`
means a person restricted it, not the evidence. `cite_observation` means
resolve the observation through emem and cite the token it returns.

A citation the node does not hold is an **allow**. It is indistinguishable from
one minted by another responder, so denying on it would punish an agent for
citing across nodes.

Add `?claim_gating=true` to also be told which measurable claims about a place
carry no citation at all, and which emem band would answer them. That rule
reports on absence rather than on a failed check, so it is opt-in everywhere
and off by default on a node you run until you have measured it on your own
traffic with `--shadow` and `--report`.

## The minimal MCP config

For every MCP host that speaks Streamable HTTP, the config reduces to
four lines:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "emem": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://emem.dev/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

That endpoint advertises the 18 core tools from `tools/list`, so the host
registers about 75 KB of descriptors rather than about 324 KB for all 114. The rest
stay callable by name, and `emem_tools` searches them or returns one tool's
schema on demand. Use `https://emem.dev/mcp/full` instead to register the
whole catalog.

**VS Code and GitHub Copilot use a different key.** The config lives in
`.vscode/mcp.json` (or the profile behind **MCP: Open User Configuration**),
and the top-level key is `servers`, not `mcpServers`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "emem": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://emem.dev/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

The wrong key fails silently: valid JSON, no server, no error. emem is also in
the GitHub MCP Registry, so VS Code can install it with no file at all, by
searching `@mcp emem` in the Extensions view or running
`code --add-mcp '{"name":"emem","type":"http","url":"https://emem.dev/mcp"}'`.
Tools then appear in Copilot Chat's **Agent** mode only; Ask mode is the
default and shows none.

Hosts without native Streamable HTTP (older releases) speak stdio
through the `mcp-remote` bridge:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "emem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://emem.dev/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## What the agent should do on first contact

The same loop applies regardless of runtime. Cache the agent card once
per session, then read directly:

1. **discover.** `GET /v1/agent_card` (or call `tools/list` on the MCP
   transport, or `emem_tools` from inside a session). Cache the result for
   the session. The card lists the tools, their JSON schemas, and trigger /
   anti-trigger phrases for tool selection. Note that `tools/list` on `/mcp`
   answers with the core tier; pass `{"tier":"all"}` or use `/mcp/full` for
   the complete catalog. `emem_tools` narrows by the shape of the answer
   (`{"shape":"raster"}`) or by job (`{"bundle":"robotics"}`), which is
   what an agent actually searches on.
2. **name.** `POST /v1/entity { "place": "<place>" }` (`emem_entity`) mints
   or returns one canonical object identity, `emem:entity:<entity_cid>`,
   so two agents co-refer instead of each inventing a description.
   `/v1/entity/resolve` converges a fuzzy phrasing onto an identity someone
   already registered.
3. **locate.** `POST /v1/locate { "q": "<place>" }` to bridge a place
   name (or lat/lng) to a `cell64`. The response reports which layer of
   the geocoder cascade answered, so the agent can score confidence.
4. **recall.** `POST /v1/recall { "cell": "<cell64>", "bands": [...] }`
   for typed scalar facts at that cell, signed. Pass
   `deterministic: true` to keep only facts recomputable from the cited
   raw source.
5. **ground, if a value is missing.** Compose `find_similar`, `compare`,
   `trajectory`, `recall_polygon`, `hunt`, or one of the nine domain
   shortcut tools (`emem_ndvi`, `emem_air`, `emem_lst`, `emem_soil`,
   `emem_water`, `emem_forest`, `emem_weather`, `emem_elevation`,
   `emem_at`). These populate the memory; they are not the point of it.
6. **cite.** `POST /v1/memory_token { "cell": "<cell64>", "fact_cid":
   "<fact_cid>" }` (`emem_memory_token`) composes
   `emem:fact:<cell64>:<fact_cid>`, the line the agent keeps instead of the
   payload. The `fact_cid` comes off the recall receipt's `fact_cids`.
   `/v1/memory_bundle` collapses many facts into one `emem:bundle:` token.
7. **resolve and verify.** Whoever receives the token calls
   `POST /v1/memory_token/resolve` (`emem_memory_token_resolve`) and gets
   the byte-identical signed body back, then checks the receipt with
   `POST /v1/verify_receipt` (`emem_verify_receipt`) or in a browser at
   `/verify`. Neither step trusts the sender, and neither needs a key. This
   is the step that makes the rest worth anything.
8. **detect drift.** `POST /v1/memory_contradictions`
   (`emem_memory_contradictions`) surfaces where signed sources disagree at
   the same address, rather than averaging the disagreement away.

## emem as the memory tier in a multi-memory agent

Most production agents already run with two memory tiers: a short-term
working buffer (the LLM's context window plus whatever scratchpad the
host ships) and a long-term store (mem0, Letta, LangGraph state, a
vector DB, a SQL log). emem slots in as a **third tier specialised for
geospatial facts**, sitting alongside whatever long-term store is
already in place:

| Tier             | Holds                                                | emem's role                                                       |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| working          | current conversation, last few turns                 | none; that is the runtime's job                                   |
| long-term store  | user preferences, project state, prior conversations | shared, signed notes via the `/memories/*` verbs, resolvable and verifiable by another agent or a later run; NOT a private store on hosted (the namespace is world-readable until owner-scoped reads ship) |
| **planetary**    | *what is at this place on Earth*                     | **emem**: signed, content-addressed, shared across all agents     |

The split keeps responsibilities clean:

- The runtime's working buffer answers *what was just said*.
- The runtime's long-term store answers *what does this user / project
  care about*.
- emem answers *what is, was, or might be at this place*: once, signed,
  byte-identical for every caller that ever asks the same question
  again.

The CID is the bridge: an agent caches `fact_cid` strings in its
runtime's long-term store, and later resolves them through emem
(`GET /v1/facts/:cid`) without needing the original query context.

## Reading-list (executable)

The fastest way to see emem behave as memory is to walk
[`examples/agent-walkthroughs.md`](../examples/agent-walkthroughs.md),
which shows real-world questions an AI agent might receive and the exact
emem calls that answer them. Every walkthrough is a copy-pasteable
`curl` sequence; pair them with the MCP config above and the same calls
run through any host's tool layer.

For the four discovery URLs an agent should fetch on cold start, see
[`docs/agents.md`](agents.md). For the protocol math and trust plane,
see [`docs/whitepaper-v2.md`](whitepaper-v2.md).
